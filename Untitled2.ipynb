      "    abstract = {We studied the long-term memory in diverse stock market indices and foreign exchange rates using Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA). For all high-frequency market data studied, no significant long-term memory property was detected in the return series, while a strong long-term memory property was found in the volatility time series. The possible causes of the long-term memory property were investigated using the return data filtered by the AR(1) model, reflecting the short-term memory property, the GARCH(1,1) model, reflecting the volatility clustering property, and the FIGARCH model, reflecting the long-term memory property of the volatility time series. The memory effect in the AR(1) filtered return and volatility time series remained unchanged, while the long-term memory property diminished significantly in the volatility series of the GARCH(1,1) filtered data. Notably, there is no long-term memory property, when we eliminate the long-term memory property of volatility by the FIGARCH model. For all data used, although the Hurst exponents of the volatility time series changed considerably over time, those of the time series with the volatility clustering effect removed diminish significantly. Our results imply that the long-term memory property of the volatility time series can be attributed to the volatility clustering observed in the financial time series.},\n",

      "    abstract = {Long memory and volatility clustering are two stylized facts frequently related to financial markets. Traditionally, these phenomena have been studied based on conditionally heteroscedastic models like ARCH, GARCH, IGARCH and FIGARCH, inter alia. One advantage of these models is their ability to capture nonlinear dynamics. Another interesting manner to study the volatility phenomenon is by using measures based on the concept of entropy. In this paper we investigate the long memory and volatility clustering for the SP 500, NASDAQ 100 and Stoxx 50 indexes in order to compare the US and European Markets. Additionally, we compare the results from conditionally heteroscedastic models with those from the entropy measures. In the latter, we examine Shannon entropy, Renyi entropy and Tsallis entropy. The results corroborate the previous evidence of nonlinear dynamics in the time series considered.},\n",

      "    abstract = {We examine the market reaction of prices, volume, spreads, and trading location when firms experience events that are totally unanticipated by the equity market in terms of both timing and content. We find that the response time is longer than previous studies have reported. Selling pressure, wider spreads, and higher volume remain significant for over an hour. We also find an immediate price reaction for overnight events; however, the market takes longer to react to events that occur when it is open. These findings may shed light on the efficacy of trading halts.},\n",

The machine conceptually implements the following idea: input vectors are non-linearly mapped to a very high-dimension feature space. In this feature space a linear decision surface is constructed. Special properties of the decision surface ensures high generalization ability of the learning machine. The idea behind the support-vector network was previously implemented for the restricted case where the training data can be separated without errors. We here extend this result to non-separable training data. High generalization ability of support-vector networks utilizing polynomial input transformations is demonstrated. We also compare the performance of the support-vector network to various classical learning algorithms that all took part in a benchmark study of Optical Character Recognition.},\n",

      "    abstract = {This paper presents a new approach for speech feature enhancement in the log-spectral domain for noisy speech recognition. A switching linear dynamic model (SLDM) is explored as a parametric model for the clean speech distribution. Each multivariate linear dynamic model (LDM) is associated with the hidden state of a hidden Markov model (HMM) as an attempt to describe the temporal correlations among adjacent frames of speech features. The state transition on the Markov chain is the process of activating a different LDM or activating some of them simultaneously by different probabilities generated by the HMM. Rather than holding a transition probability for the whole process, a connectionist model is employed to learn the time variant transition probabilities. With the resulting SLDM as the speech model and with a model for the noise, speech and noise are jointly tracked by means of switching Kalman filtering. Comprehensive experiments are carried out using the Aurora2 database to evaluate the new algorithm. The results show that the new SLDM approach can further improve the speech feature enhancement performance in terms of noise-robust recognition accuracy, since the transition probabilities among the LDMs can be described more precisely at each time point.},\n",

      "    abstract = {Undirected graphical models are widely used in statistics, physics, and, machine vision. However, Bayesian parameter estimation for undirected models is extremely challenging, since evaluation of the posterior typically involves the calculation of an intractable normalizing constant. This problem has received much attention, but very little of this has focused on the important practical case where the data consist of noisy or incomplete observations of the underlying hidden structure. This article specifically addresses this problem, comparing two alternate methodologies. In the first of these approaches, particle Markov chain Monte Carlo (Andrieu, Doucet, and Holenstein) is used to efficiently explore the parameter space, combined with the exchange algorithm (Murray, Ghahramani, and MacKay) for avoiding the calculation of the intractable normalizing constant (a proof showing that this combination targets the correct distribution is given in Appendix A available in the online supplementary materials). This approach is compared with approximate Bayesian computation (Pritchard et al.). Applications to estimating the parameters of Ising models and exponential random graphs from noisy data are presented. Each algorithm used in the article targets an approximation to the true posterior due to the use of Markov chain Monte Carlo method (MCMC) to simulate from the latent graphical model, in lieu of being able to do this exactly, in general. Appendix B (online supplementary materials) also describes the nature of the resulting approximation. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},\n",

      "    abstract = {This paper presents a multimodal system for reliable human identity recognition under variant conditions. Our system fuses the recognition of face and speech with a general probabilistic framework For face recognition, we propose a new spectral learning algorithm, which considers not only the discriminative relations among the training data but also the generative models for each class. Due to the tedious cost of face labeling in practice, our spectral face learning utilizes a semi-supervised strategy. That is, only a small number of labeled faces are used in our training step, and the labels are optimally propagated to other unlabeled training faces. Besides requiring much less labeled data, our algorithm also enables a natural way to explicitly train an outlier model that approximately represents unauthorized faces. To boost the robustness of our system for human recognition under various environments, our face recognition is further complemented by a speaker identification agent. Specifically, this agent models the statistical variations of fixed-phrase speech using speaker-dependent word hidden Markov models. Experiments on benchmark databases validate the effectiveness of our face recognition and speaker identification agents, and demonstrate that the recognition accuracy can be apparently improved by integrating these two independent biometric sources together.

      "    abstract = {Introduction. Polysomnography (PSG) is one of the most important noninvasive methods for studying maturation of the child brain. Sleep in infants is significantly different from sleep in adults. This paper addresses the problem of computer analysis of neonatal polygraphic signals. Methods. We applied methods designed for differentiating three important neonatal behavioral states: quiet sleep, active sleep, and wakefulness. The proportion of these states is a significant indicator of the maturity of the newborn brain in clinical practice. In this study, we used data provided by the Institute for Care of Mother and Child, Prague (12 newborn infants of similar postconceptional age). The data were scored by an experienced physician to four states (wake, quiet sleep, active sleep, movement artifact). For accurate classification; it was necessary to determine the most informative features. We used a method based on power spectral density (PSD) applied to each EEG channel. We also used features derived from electrooculogram (EOG), electromyogram (EMG), ECG, and respiration [pneumogram (PNG)] signals. The most informative feature was the measure of regularity of respiration from the PNG signal. We designed an algorithm for interpreting these characteristics. This algorithm was based on Markov models. Results. The results of automatic detection of sleep states were compared to the “sleep profiles” determined visually. We evaluated both the success rate and the true positive rate of the classification, and statistically significant agreement of the two scorings was found. Two variants, for learning and for testing, were applied, namely learning from the data of all 12 newborns and tenfold cross-validation, and learning from the data of 11 newborns and testing on the data from the 12th newborn. We utilized information obtained from several biological signals (EEG, ECG, PNG, EMG, EOG) for our final classification. We reached the final success rate of 82.5\\%. The true positive rate was 81.8\\% and the false positive rate was 6.1 \\%. Discussion. The most important step in the whole process is feature extraction and feature selection. In this process, we used visualization as an additional tool that helped us to decide which features to select. Proper selection of features may significantly influence the success rate of the classification. We made a visual comparison of the computed features with the manual scoring provided by the expert. A hidden Markov model was used for classification. The advantage of this model is that it determines the future behavior of the process by its present state. In this way, it preserves information about temporal development.},\n",

Beginning with the vowel/consonant distinction. we consider a method for its discovery by the Russian linguist Boris Sukchotin, and compare it to two newer methods of more general interest, both computational and theoretical, today. The first is based on spectral decomposition of matrices, allowing for dimensionality reduction in a finely controlled way, and the second is based on finding parameters for maximum likelihood in a hidden Markov model. While all three methods work for discovering the fairly robust vowel/consonant distinction, we extend the newer ones to the discovery of vowel harmony, and in the case of the probabilistic model, to the discovery of some aspects of syllable structure.},\n",

Possible order flow imbalances are examined by looking at the proximity of transaction prices to contemporaneous bid and ask quotes. While order flow imbalances are evident for bad news announcements, this is not the case for the dividend increase sample. This is interpreted as evidence that the price reaction to major dividend increases are in general anticipated. Fifteen minute holding period returns are computed to measure the movement of equilibrium prices during the announcement period. Results show a rapid adjustment of prices to positive announcements with adjustment to negative announcements taking up to 75 minutes. Finally, fifteen minute lagged bid-ask returns are calculated to determine whether an investor could respond to the announcement and earn positive returns. These results are found to be dependent on the transaction cost assumptions being made.},\n",

They capture the dependence structure of a multivariate distribution over its whole range detached from its specific margins. In contrast to a single measure of association, this allows for varying strength of dependence throughout the multivariate distribution. Thus, copulas are capable of capturing many different (i.e. non-Gaussian) dependence structures and allow for asymmetric dependencies which can be found in many natural processes. We applied this approach to data from the deforestation survey of the Brazilian Amazon in order to capture the dependence of deforestation on a selection of variables.},\n",

Our findings highlight that volatility clustering, contrary to widespread belief, is not only present in high-frequency financial data. Monthly data also exhibit significant serial dependence in the second moments.

We observe leptokurtic returns and a slowly decaying autocorrelation function of absolute returns. In contrast to results from heterogeneous agent models (HAMs), we find that noise has no significant influence on the emergence of fat tails. Instead, we observe a significantly positive relationship between the degree of heterogeneity of fundamental information and absolute returns, which suggests that heterogeneous fundamental information is the source of fat tails. With respect to volatility clustering, we discover an intra-periodical pattern where absolute returns decrease after the arrival of new asymmetric fundamental information.},\n",

      "    abstract = {For wideband Cognitive Radio (CR) devices, the availability of primary user (PU) activity prediction model can save sensing energy and time, track spectrum variations, reduce switching overhead, improve spectrum usage and lower interference to PU. Using Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) generated data, this paper has verified the superiority of Hidden Semi-Markov model (HSMM) over the conventional HMM in learning and predicting temporal correlations in PU spectral activity under non-geometric distribution of state durations. Numerical simulations further show that in a coordinated multi-SU/PU scenario, compared to the traditional random Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA), the proposed HSMM-dynamic spectrum allocation (DSA) protocol significantly reduces aggregate interference to PU. Depending on the number of SU, there exists a trade-off between interference-free coexistence with PU and self-existence of a large number of SU. This problem is addressed further by statistically modeling probability of free channels and using it to optimize the number of SU that can be allocated. The proposed scheme outperforms the conventional sensing based dynamic spectrum allocation (DSA) in terms of reduced PU interference, lower spectrum handoff requirements and higher spectrum utilization efficiency. The predictive optimized HSMM-DSA can be used as an additional layer of intelligence for any CR device for efficient spectrum sharing.},\n",

      "    abstract = {This paper presents a novel graph-based framework which can combine context, consistency, and diversity cues for interactive image categorization. The image representation is first formed with visual keywords by dividing images into blocks and then performing clustering on these blocks. The context across visual keywords within an image is further captured by proposing a 2-D spatial Markov chain model. To develop a graph-based approach to image categorization, we incorporate intra-image context into a new class of kernel called spatial Markov kernel which can be used to define the affinity matrix for a graph. After graph construction with this kernel, the large unlabeled data can be exploited by graph-based semi-supervised learning through label propagation with inter-image consistency. For interactive image categorization, we further combine this semi-supervised learning with active learning by defining a new diversity-based data selection criterion using spectral embedding. Experiments then demonstrate that the proposed framework can achieve promising results.},\n",

      "    abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel approach for accurate modeling of computer workloads. According to this approach, the sequences of features generated by a program during its execution are considered as time series and are processed with signal processing techniques both for feature extraction and statistical pattern matching. In the feature extraction phase we used spectral analysis for describing the sequence and to retain the important information. In the pattern matching phase we used a simplified form of bidimensional Hidden Markov Model, called pseudo2D-HMM, as Statistical Machine Learning Algorithm. Several processes of the same workload are necessary to obtain a 2D-HMM model of the workload. In this way, the models are obtained in an initial training phase; we developed techniques for on-line workload classification of a running process and for synthetic traces generation. The proposed algorithms is evaluated via trace-driven simulations using the SPEC 2000 workloads. We show that pseudo2D-HMMs accurately describe memory references sequences; the classification accuracy is about 92\\% with six different workloads.},\n",

      "    abstract = {In recent years, there has been a great deal of work in modeling audio using non-negative matrix factorization and its probabilistic counterparts as they yield rich models that are very useful for source separation and automatic music transcription. Given a sound source, these algorithms learn a dictionary of spectral vectors to best explain it. This dictionary is however learned in a manner that disregards a very important aspect of sound, its temporal structure. We propose a novel algorithm, the non-negative hidden Markov model (N-HMM), that extends the aforementioned models by jointly learning several small spectral dictionaries as well as a Markov chain that describes the structure of changes between these dictionaries. We also extend this algorithm to the non-negative factorial hidden Markov model (N-FHMM) to model sound mixtures, and demonstrate that it yields superior performance in single channel source separation tasks.},\n",

A frequency spectral information is incorporated to the conventional Mel spectrum base speech recognition approach. The Mel frequency approach exploits the frequency observation for speech signal in a given resolution which results in resolution feature overlapping resulting in recognition limit. Resolution decomposition with separating frequency is mapping approach for a HMM based speech recognition system. The Simulation results show a improvement in the quality metrics of speech recognition with respect to computational time, learning accuracy for a speech recognition system.},\n",

      "    abstract = {We use high-frequency spot prices from the Australian New South Wales (NSW) electricity market to calculate the non-parametric realized volatility as well as identify price jumps. We show that the residuals of the heterogeneous autoregressive (HAR) models of realized volatility still exhibit volatility clustering. Therefore, we extend the HAR models by characterizing such time-varying volatility of realized volatility through three GARCH-type models: the GARCH model, the long-memory FIGARCH model, and the asymmetric EGARCH model. Furthermore, we augment the above HAR-GARCH-type models to capture the inverse leverage effect and to exploit the errors in realized volatility estimators. The resulting models are referred to as the HARQ-L-GARCH-type models. They each have better in-sample fit than the corresponding HAR-GARCH-type models, whose in-sample fit are much better than the benchmark HAR models. More importantly, Diebold-Mariano tests on out-of-sample forecasts reinforce our extensions, as the forecast accuracy of the HAR-GARCH-type models significantly outperforms that of the benchmark HAR models under six conventional criteria, and the forecast accuracy of the HARQ-L-GARCH-type models is even higher. Finally, the model confidence set tests indicate that, 1) modeling the residual variance with the GARCH structure and the FIGARCH structure can more effectively improve the out-of-sample forecasting performance of the HAR models. 2) Incorporating jumps in the HAR structure improves the out-of-sample forecasting performance. 3) The HARQ-L-CJ-GARCH model is superior for predicting volatility in the NSW electricity market.},\n",

      "    abstract = {There is growing interest in understanding the dynamical properties of functional interactions between distributed brain regions. However, robust estimation of temporal dynamics from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data remains challenging due to limitations in extant multivariate methods for modeling time-varying functional interactions between multiple brain areas. Here, we develop a Bayesian generative model for fMRI time-series within the framework of hidden Markov models (HMMs). The model is a dynamic variant of the static factor analysis model (Ghahramani and Beal, 2000). We refer to this model as Bayesian switching factor analysis (BSFA) as it integrates factor analysis into a generative HMM in a unified Bayesian framework. In BSFA, brain dynamic functional networks are represented by latent states which are learnt from the data. Crucially, BSFA is a generative model which estimates the temporal evolution of brain states and transition probabilities between states as a function of time. An attractive feature of BSFA is the automatic determination of the number of latent states via Bayesian model selection arising from penalization of excessively complex models. Key features of BSFA are validated using extensive simulations on carefully designed synthetic data. We further validate BSFA using fingerprint analysis of multisession resting-state fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Our results show that modeling temporal dependencies in the generative model of BSFA results in improved fingerprinting of individual participants. Finally, we apply BSFA to elucidate the dynamic functional organization of the salience, central-executive, and default mode networks-three core neurocognitive systems with central role in cognitive and affective information processing (Menon, 2011). Across two HCP sessions, we demonstrate a high level of dynamic interactions between these networks and determine that the salience network has the highest temporal flexibility among the three networks. Our proposed methods provide a novel and powerful generative model for investigating dynamic brain connectivity.},\n",

The method is based on concepts originally developed for analyzing chaotic time-series. A signal segment is transformed into trajectory in m-dimensional state space by using embedding procedure. Close pairs of points on the trajectory with the distance between them less than prescribed neighborhood radius are found and their time separations are computed. A periodicity histogram for the distribution of computed time separations is characterized by distinct peaks corresponding to pitch period and its multiples for periodic regions, and by the absence of such peaks for aperiodic regions. The proposed method does not suffer from the limitations of other short-term pitch-estimation techniques. Updated information and demo software can be found at www.soundmathtech.com/pitch.},\n",

      "    abstract = {Volatility clustering is a pervasive feature of equity markets. This article studies volatility clustering in an equilibrium setting by generalizing the CRRA and CARA representative agent models of finance. In equilibrium, the market portfolio follows a volatility regime-switching process in which the volatility level is determined by the agent's local risk aversion. Using monthly data, the empirical tests reveal that at least four volatility regimes are necessary to fit the data. While one of the models explains the GARCH effects in the data, an analysis of the Euler equation pricing errors suggests that both models are likely misspecified. Since the models can be used to closely approximate any state-independent utility function, it is doubtful that there exists any representative agent equilibrium (with state-independent utility) that is consistent with the data. An equivalent interpretation is that the market portfolio price process is not a diffusion process of the type studied by Bick [Bick, A., On viable diffusion price processes of the market portfolio, J. Finance 45 (1990) 673–689] and He and Leland [He, H., Leland, H., On equilibrium asset price processes, Rev. Financ. Stud. 6 (1993) 593–617].},\n",

      "    abstract = {Previous studies found that extended futures trading contains useful information in explaining subsequent overnight spot returns. This study therefore compares the performance of using the extended trading of the TAIFEX (Taiwan Futures Exchange) index futures and single-stock futures to predict their opening underlying spot prices. Furthermore, according to the efficient market hypothesis, the share price fully reflects all the information available and should adjust to new information instantaneously. However, several studies have demonstrated that short-sales restrictions delay the speed of price adjustment to negative information. The relevant question is whether short-selling restrictions also slow down the speed at which the opening spot price adjusts to the new information revealed through extended futures trading, and thus reducing the price prediction function of extended futures trading. The empirical results find that using the opening futures price and the prediction method proposed in this study can more accurately predict the opening spot price on the same day. Furthermore, the performance of using the extended trading of index futures to predict the opening spot index price is superior to that of using the extended trading of single-stock futures to predict the opening stock price. Finally, as found in previous studies, short-selling restrictions also slow down the speed of stock price adjustment to the new information revealed through extended futures trading. Thus both the up-tick rule and the short-selling bans (especially the latter) negatively affect the price forecasting performance of extended futures trading.},\n",

      "    abstract = {Human motion analysis is increasingly attracting much attention from computer vision researchers. This paper aims to address the task of human gait and activity analysis from image sequences by learning and recognition of sequential data under a general integrated framework. Human movements generally exhibit intrinsically nonlinear spatiotemporal characteristics in the high-dimensional ambient space. An attractive framework, which we explore here, is to: (1) Extract simple and reliable features from image sequences. (2) Find a low-dimensional feature representation embedded in high-dimensional image data. (3) Then characterize/classify the motions in this low-dimensional feature space. We examine two simple alternatives for step 1: silhouette and a distance transformed silhouette; and three quite different methods for step 3: Gaussian mixture models (GMM) based classification, a matching-based approach with the mean Hausdorff distance, and continuous hidden Markov models (HMM) based modelling and recognition. The core is step 2 where we choose to use LPP (locality preserving projections), an optimal linear approximation to a nonlinear spectral embedding technique (i.e., Laplacian eigenmap). In essence our aim is to see whether this core, together with simple approaches to steps I and 3, can solve problems across several types of human gait and activity. To see how well the proposed framework performs, we carry out extensive experiments in three related domains: human activity recognition, abnormal gait analysis, and gait-based human identification. The experimental results show that the proposed framework performs well across all three areas. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},\n",

      "    abstract = {In this paper, we explore the generalization capability of acoustic model for improving speech recognition robustness against noise distortions. While generalization in statistical learning theory originally refers to the model's ability to generalize well on unseen testing data drawn from the same distribution as that of the training data, we show that good generalization capability is also desirable for mismatched cases. One way to obtain such general models is to use margin-based model training method, e. g., soft-margin estimation (SME), to enable some tolerance to acoustic mismatches without a detailed knowledge about the distortion mechanisms through enhancing margins between competing models. Experimental results on the Aurora-2 and Aurora-3 connected digit string recognition tasks demonstrate that, by improving the model's generalization capability through SME training, speech recognition performance can be significantly improved in both matched and low to medium mismatched testing cases with no language model constraints. Recognition results show that SME indeed performs better with than without mean and variance normalization, and therefore provides a complimentary benefit to conventional feature normalization techniques such that they can be combined to further improve the system performance. Although this study is focused on noisy speech recognition, we believe the proposed margin-based learning framework can be extended to dealing with different types of distortions and robustness issues in other machine learning applications.},\n",

For this purpose, the study analyzes the futures dataset that contains information on transaction times, trade directions, order sizes, and the types of investors initiating the transactions. The results suggest several novel findings. First, a substantial portion of the price impact of futures trades is persistent, indicating the presence of informed trading in the futures market. Second, informed trading is concentrated in the opening period and liquidity trading is concentrated in the closing period of the continuous trading session. Third, small trades usually have a greater price impact than large ones, supporting the existence of stealth trading by futures traders. Fourth, trades by institutional investors have a greater price impact than those by individuals, suggesting that institutional investors are better informed and/or more sophisticated than individual investors in the futures market.</p>},\n",

A related strand of literature focuses on dynamic models and covariance forecasting for high-frequency data based covariance measures. The aim of this paper is to investigate whether more sophisticated estimation approaches lead to more precise covariance forecasts, both in a statistical precision sense and in terms of economic value. A further issue, we address, is the relative importance of the quality of the realized measure as an input in a given forecasting model vs. the model's dynamic specification. The main finding is that the largest gains result from switching from daily to high-frequency data.

In recent years, different non-parametric estimators of the variation of a log-price process have appeared. Among them are the realized quadratic (co-)variation which is perhaps the most well known example, providing a consistent estimator of the integrated (co-)volatility when the logarithmic price process is continuous. In this paper, we propose to study the large deviation properties of realized (co-)volatility. Our main motivation is to improve upon the existing limit theorems such as the weak law of large numbers or the central limit theorem which have been proved in different contexts. Our large deviations results can be used to evaluate and approximate tail probabilities of realized (co-)volatility. As an application we provide the large deviations for the standard dependence measures between the two assets returns such as the realized regression coefficients or the realized correlation. Our study should contribute to the recent trend of research on the (co-)variance estimation problems, which are quite often discussed in high-frequency financial data analysis. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This approach allows us to employ volatility estimators that achieve very low Root Mean Squared Errors (RMSEs) compared to other estimators that have been proposed to deal with market microstructure noise at high frequencies. Furthermore, this price series decomposition allows us to estimate the variance covariance matrix of n assets in a more efficient way than the methods so far proposed in the literature.

Some of the definitions of long memory are reviewed, together with previous work in other disciplines. Section 3 describes the population characteristics of various long memory processes in the mean, including ARFIMA. Section 4 is concerned with estimation and examines semiparametric procedures in both the frequency and time domain, and also the properties of various regression based and maximum likelihood techniques. Long memory volatility processes are discussed in Section 5, while Section 6 discusses applications in economics and finance. The paper also has a concluding section.</p>},\n",

Empirical analysis of completed transactions data based on the Dealing 2000-2 electronic inter-dealer broking system indicates significant evidence of intraday seasonality in returns and return volatilities under usual market conditions. Moreover, analysis of realised tail outcomes supports seasonality for extraordinary market conditions across the trading day.},\n",

The algorithm is derived from a theory in nonconvex optimization related to the diffusion equation. The contributions made in this work are two fold. First, we show how some seemingly disconnected mechanisms used in deep learning such as smart initialization, annealed learning rate, layerwise pretraining, and noise injection (as done in dropout and SGD) arise naturally and automatically from this framework, without manually crafting them into the algorithms. Second, we present some preliminary results on comparing the proposed method against SGD. It turns out that the new algorithm can achieve similar level of generalization accuracy of SGD in much fewer number of epochs.},\n",

We frame learning as an optimization minimizing a two-sample test statistic---informally speaking, a good generator network produces samples that cause a two-sample test to fail to reject the null hypothesis. As our two-sample test statistic, we use an unbiased estimate of the maximum mean discrepancy, which is the centerpiece of the nonparametric kernel two-sample test proposed by Gretton et al. (2012). We compare to the adversarial nets framework introduced by Goodfellow et al. (2014), in which learning is a two-player game between a generator network and an adversarial discriminator network, both trained to outwit the other. From this perspective, the MMD statistic plays the role of the discriminator. In addition to empirical comparisons, we prove bounds on the generalization error incurred by optimizing the empirical MMD.},\n",

      "    abstract = {Generative moment matching network (GMMN) is a deep generative model that differs from Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) by replacing the discriminator in GAN with a two-sample test based on kernel maximum mean discrepancy (MMD). Although some theoretical guarantees of MMD have been studied, the empirical performance of GMMN is still not as competitive as that of GAN on challenging and large benchmark datasets. The computational efficiency of GMMN is also less desirable in comparison with GAN, partially due to its requirement for a rather large batch size during the training. In this paper, we propose to improve both the model expressiveness of GMMN and its computational efficiency by introducing adversarial kernel learning techniques, as the replacement of a fixed Gaussian kernel in the original GMMN. The new approach combines the key ideas in both GMMN and GAN, hence we name it MMD GAN. The new distance measure in MMD GAN is a meaningful loss that enjoys the advantage of weak topology and can be optimized via gradient descent with relatively small batch sizes. In our evaluation on multiple benchmark datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR- 10, CelebA and LSUN, the performance of MMD-GAN significantly outperforms GMMN, and is competitive with other representative GAN works.},\n",

      "    abstract = {Machine learning, and in particular neural network models, have revolutionized fields such as image, text, and speech recognition. Today, many important real-world applications in these areas are driven by neural networks. There are also growing applications in engineering, robotics, medicine, and finance. Despite their immense success in practice, there is limited mathematical understanding of neural networks. This paper illustrates how neural networks can be studied via stochastic analysis, and develops approaches for addressing some of the technical challenges which arise. We analyze one-layer neural networks in the asymptotic regime of simultaneously (A) large network sizes and (B) large numbers of stochastic gradient descent training iterations. We rigorously prove that the empirical distribution of the neural network parameters converges to the solution of a nonlinear partial differential equation. This result can be considered a law of large numbers for neural networks. In addition, a consequence of our analysis is that the trained parameters of the neural network asymptotically become independent, a property which is commonly called \"propagation of chaos\".},\n",

      "    abstract = {Although the existence of a north-south asymmetry in solar activity is generally accepted, a detailed study of its significance and behaviour is still missing. In this paper, we present a thorough study of the north-south asymmetry of solar activity made with the daily sunspot areas, since they are a good indicator of magnetic activity. To perform the study, we have constructed an asymmetry time series and analysed it by different methods. First of all, its significance and statistical behaviour has been studied. Secondly, using a Montecarlo simulation we have generated synthetic asymmetries and compared them to the real one by means of an $\\chi$2-test of goodness of fit, and thirdly, we have used modern techniques, developed to study the chaotic behaviour of time series, to search for low-dimensional deterministic chaos in the asymmetry time series. Our results show that in most cases the north-south asymmetry is statistically highly significant, i.e. it is a real feature of sunspot areas distribution, and that it cannot be obtained from a distribution of sunspot areas generated, in a random way, from a binomial or uniform distribution of probability between hemispheres; moreover, synthetic asymmetries obtained from the Morfill et al. (1991) model, which seems to reproduce realistically the sunspot cycle, do not agree with the real one and the real asymmetry time series can be represented by means of a multicomponent model made up of a long-term trend, a sinusoidal component with a period of 12.1 yr and a dominant purely random component. Also, the chaotic analysis does not reveal the existence of a strange attractor in the time series and its multifractal properties indicate that intermittency or bursts of activity are present in it.},\n",

Temporal irreversibility is important because it excludes Gaussian linear dynamics and static transformations of such dynamics from the set of possible generating processes. A symbolic method for measuring temporal irreversibility is attractive because it is computationally efficient, robust to noise, and simplifies statistical analysis of confidence limits. We propose a specific algorithm, called \"false flipped symbols,\" for establishing the presence of temporal irreversibility without the need for generating surrogate data. Besides characterizing experimental data, our results are relevant to the question of selecting alternative models.

Here we show how a set of isovists can be used to generate a graph of mutual visibility between locations. We demonstrate that this graph can also be constructed without reference to isovists and that we are in fact invoking the more general concept of a visibility graph. Using the visibility graph, we can extend both isovist and current graph-based analyses of architectural space to form a new methodology for the investigation of configurational relationships. The measurement of local and global characteristics of the graph, for each vertex or for the system as a whole, is of interest from an architectural perspective, allowing us to describe a configuration with reference to accessibility and visibility, to compare from location to location within a system, and to compare systems with different geometries. Finally we show that visibility graph properties may be closely related to manifestations of spatial perception, such as way-finding, movement, and space use.},\n",

This fact is interesting as these quantities are even invariant if no embedding is used. This is an important advantage of RPs compared to other techniques of nonlinear data analysis. These estimates for the correlation dimension and entropy are robust and, moreover, can be obtained at a low numerical cost. We exemplify our results for the R{\\\"{o}}ssler system, the funnel attractor and the Mackey Glass system. In the last part of the paper we estimate dynamical invariants for data from some fluid dynamical experiments and confirm previous evidence for low dimensional chaos in this experimental system.},\n",

We investigate the statistical properties of these networks for various time series and find that time series with different dynamics exhibit distinct topological structures. Specifically, noisy periodic signals correspond to random networks, and chaotic time series generate networks that exhibit small world and scale free features. We show that this distinction in topological structure results from the hierarchy of unstable periodic orbits embedded in the chaotic attractor. Standard measures of structure in complex networks can therefore be applied to distinguish different dynamic regimes in time series. Application to human electrocardiograms shows that such statistical properties are able to differentiate between the sinus rhythm cardiograms of healthy volunteers and those of coronary care patients.},\n",

The difference of the recurrence properties between quasiperiodic and chaotic orbits is revisited, which helps to understand the complex patterns of the corresponding RPs. Moreover, several measures from the recurrence quantification analysis are used to quantify these patterns. Among these measures, the recurrence rate, quantifying the percentage of black points in the plot, is applied to characterize the stickiness of a typical chaotic orbit. The advantage of the recurrence based method in comparison to other standard techniques is that it is possible to distinguish between quasiperiodic and chaotic orbits that are temporarily trapped in a sticky domain, from very short trajectories.},\n",

In this letter, we introduce an advanced statistical framework that allows an appropriate analysis of these relationships. Methods: We combine wavelet analysis with statistical measures of phase coherence to obtain well-defined phase differences in dependence on the selected oscillation period. Results: Our approach characterises the temporally varying phase difference of the hemispheric sunspot activity over the past 130 years, which is a major contribution to the north-south asymmetry. Coherent phase variables are found to exist for a frequency band with periodicities around the dominating 11-year cycle. We observe significant continuous long-term variability of interhemispheric phase shifts, which is not reproduced by solar activity records from previous centuries.},\n",

The traffic dynamics can then be studied by investigating the statistical properties of those networks. According to Kerner's three-phase theory, there are two different phases in congested traffic, synchronized flow and wide moving jam. In the framework of this theory, we study different properties of synchronized flow and moving jam in relation to complex network. Scale-free network is constructed in stop-and-go traffic, i.e., a sequence of moving jams [Chin. Phys. Lett. 10, 2711 (2005)]. In this work, the networks generated in synchronized flow are investigated in detail. Simulation results show that the degree distribution of the networks constructed in synchronized flow has two power law regions, so the distinction in topological structure can really reflect the different dynamics in traffic flow. Furthermore, the real traffic data are investigated by this method, and the results are consistent with the simulations.},\n",

In the model, the nodes in the network are represented by the traffic flow states, the links in the network are represented by the transform of the traffic flow states, and the traffic flow transported when performing the transform of the traffic flow states is considered as the weight of the link. Several topological features of this generalized weighted model, such as the degree distribution and strength distribution, have been numerically studied. A scaling behavior between the strength and degree s ∼ k log k is obtained. By introducing some constraints to the generalized weighted model, we study its subnetworks and find that the scaling behavior between the strength and degree is conserved, though the topology properties are quite sensitive to the constraints. {\\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

      "    abstract = {Conformational dynamics of proteins can be interpreted as itinerant motions as the protein traverses from one state to another on a complex network in conformational space or, more generally, in state space. Here we present a scheme to extract a multiscale state space network (SSN) from a single-molecule time series. Analysis by this method enables us to lift degeneracy--different physical states having the same value for a measured observable--as much as possible. A state or node in the network is defined not by the value of the observable at each time but by a set of subsequences of the observable over time. The length of the subsequence can tell us the extent to which the memory of the system is able to predict the next state. As an illustration, we investigate the conformational fluctuation dynamics probed by single-molecule electron transfer (ET), detected on a photon-by-photon basis. We show that the topographical features of the SSNs depend on the time scale of observation; the longer the time scale, the simpler the underlying SSN becomes, leading to a transition of the dynamics from anomalous diffusion to normal Brownian diffusion.},\n",

In this work, we review and compare different possible approaches to detect and quantify the phase coherence between time series of oscillatory systems. In particular, methods originated in the theory of phase synchronisation phenomena and the concept of recurrence plots are considered. As a particular example, the sunspot activity on both solar hemispheres and the corresponding phenomenon of north-south asymmetry are studied. It is shown that this asymmetry can be understood in terms of a different \"phase diffusion\" of two coupled chaotic oscillators, which do however evolve coherently in time. The statistical reliability and implications of this result are discussed. Apart from the particular problem of sunspot activity, the methods described in this chapter may be used to study a variety of other phenomena in geoscientific systems, for example, the coherent motion of certain atmospheric oscillation patterns.},\n",

Both the cross-wavelet transform (XWT) and wavelet coherence (WTC) indicate the prominent period with 95{\\%} confidence level, namely the Schwabe cycle of about 11 years. The Schwabe cycle is in phase in the two hemispheres. Within the 11-year frequency band, there is a small phase difference during the period of 1966 - 1975 when the activity of polar faculae in the northern hemisphere slightly leads the one in the southern hemisphere. A cross-recurrence plot analysis and the line of synchronization (LOS) extracted from the cross-recurrence plot show further the phase difference between the two hemispheres. The LOS deviates significantly from the main diagonal during the period of 1965 - 1970 and LOS {\\textgreater} 0, showing that the activity of polar faculae in the northern hemisphere leads in phase, which is in accordance with XWT and WTC analyses.

      "    abstract = {We propose in this paper a reliable method for constructing complex networks from a time series with each vector point of the reconstructed phase space represented by a single node and edge determined by the phase space distance. Through investigating an extensive range of network topology statistics, we find that the constructed network inherits the main properties of the time series in its structure. Specifically, periodic series and noisy series convert into regular networks and random networks, respectively, and networks generated from chaotic series typically exhibit small-world and scale-free features. Furthermore, we associate different aspects of the dynamics of the time series with the topological indices of the network and demonstrate how such statistics can be used to distinguish different dynamical regimes. Through analyzing the chaotic time series corrupted by measurement noise, we also indicate the good antinoise ability of our method.},\n",

      "    abstract = {The visibility algorithm has been recently introduced as a mapping between time series and complex networks. This procedure allows to apply methods of complex network theory for characterizing time series. In this work we present the horizontal visibility algorithm, a geometrically simpler and analytically solvable version of our former algorithm, focusing on the mapping of random series (series of independent identically distributed random variables). After presenting some properties of the algorithm, we present exact results on the topological properties of graphs associated to random series, namely the degree distribution, clustering coefficient, and mean path length. We show that the horizontal visibility algorithm stands as a simple method to discriminate randomness in time series, since any random series maps to a graph with an exponential degree distribution of the shape P(k) = (1/3)(2/3)**(k-2), independently of the probability distribution from which the series was generated. Accordingly, visibility graphs with other P(k) are related to non-random series. Numerical simulations confirm the accuracy of the theorems for finite series. In a second part, we show that the method is able to distinguish chaotic series from i.i.d. theory, studying the following situations: (i) noise-free low-dimensional chaotic series, (ii) low-dimensional noisy chaotic series, even in the presence of large amounts of noise, and (iii) high-dimensional chaotic series (coupled map lattice), without needs for additional techniques such as surrogate data or noise reduction methods. Finally, heuristic arguments are given to explain the topological properties of chaotic series and several sequences which are conjectured to be random are analyzed.},\n",

The investigation of this phenomenon is important to explaining the almost-periodic behaviour of solar cycles. MethodsWe use cross-recurrence plots for the study of the time-varying phase asymmetry of the northern and southern hemisphere and compare our results with the latitudinal distribution of the sunspots. ResultsWe observe a long-term persistence of phase leading in one of the hemispheres, which lasts almost 4 solar cycles and probably corresponds to the Gleissberg cycle. Long-term variations in the hemispheric-leading do not demonstrate clear periodicity but are strongly anti-correlated with the long-term variations in the magnetic equator.},\n",

We investigate the visibility graphs extracted from fractional Brownian motions and multifractal random walks, and find that the degree distributions exhibit power-law behaviors, in which the power-law exponent $\\alpha$ is a linear function of the Hurst index H of the time series. We also find that the degree distribution of the visibility graph is mainly determined by the temporal correlation of the original time series with minor influence from the possible multifractal nature. As an example, we study the visibility graphs constructed from three Chinese stock market indexes and unveil that the degree distributions have power-law tails, where the tail exponents of the visibility graphs and the Hurst indexes of the indexes are close to the $\\alpha$ ∼ H linear relationship. {\\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In this work, we investigate 30 world stock market indices through their visibility graphs by adopting the visibility algorithm to convert each single stock index into one visibility graph. A universal allometric scaling law is uncovered in the minimal spanning trees, whose scaling exponent is independent of the stock market and the length of the stock index. In contrast, the maximal spanning trees and the random spanning trees do not exhibit universal allometric scaling behaviors. There are marked discrepancies in the allometric scaling behaviors between the stock indices and the Brownian motions. Using surrogate time series, we find that these discrepancies are caused by the fat-tailedness of the return distribution, the nonlinear long-term correlation, and a coupling effect between these two influence factors.},\n",

While for discrete systems, a discrimination between periodic and chaotic windows can be easily made based on the maximum Lyapunov exponent of the system, this remains a challenging task for continuous systems, especially if only short time series are available (e.g., in case of experimental data). In this work, we demonstrate that nonlinear measures based on recurrence plots obtained from such trajectories provide a practicable alternative for numerically detecting shrimps. Traditional diagonal line-based measures of recurrence quantification analysis as well as measures from complex network theory are shown to allow an excellent classification of periodic and chaotic behavior in parameter space. Using the well-studied R?ssler system as a benchmark example, we find that the average path length and the clustering coefficient of the resulting recurrence networks are particularly powerful discriminatory statistics for the identification of complex periodic windows.},\n",

We identify the recurrence matrix (calculated from time series) with the adjacency matrix of a complex network and apply measures for the characterisation of complex networks to this recurrence matrix. We illustrate similarities and differences between the recurrence quantification analysis and the complex network analysis. By using the logistic map, we demonstrate the potential of the complex network measures for the detection of different dynamical regimes. Pre-eclampsia in pregnancy is a serious disease with high risk of fetal and maternal morbidity. The usual positive predictive value is 20--30{\\%}.

      "    abstract = {A traditional way to quantify synchronous interactions between animals has been to use concordance indices, which commonly do not take into account the effects of the length of the sampling time and of behaviour driven by third parties. We overcame these issues by casting the process of investigating behavioural interactions into a network inference methodology. We summarized multivariate time series using a complex network whose construction depends on a surrogate hypothesis testing data analysis of synchronous interactions between animals. The method accounts for the effect of third parties on pairwise comparisons, allows one to test the effect of the size of the sampling window on the interactions between animals, and allows one to test behavioural models of increasing complexity. We used a continuous 1-month behavioural data set of the foraging activity of a mixed-sex group of 40 Soay sheep, Ovis aries. We uncovered underlying patterns of behavioural interaction between individual sheep by applying our inferential approach to the symbolic multivariate time series of activity, that is grazing, not grazing. Our findings clearly indicate that animals of the same sex are more synchronized than animals of different sex independent of body size. We advocate that the method proposed is more general and more efficient at detecting patterns of synchronization than traditional concordance indices. We provide the reader with a comprehensive software toolbox to apply the methodology proposed. {\\textcopyright} 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},\n",

Starting from the concept of recurrences in phase space, the recurrence matrix of a time series is interpreted as the adjacency matrix of an associated complex network, which links different points in time if the considered states are closely neighboured in phase space. In comparison with similar network-based techniques the new approach has important conceptual advantages, and can be considered as a unifying framework for transforming time series into complex networks that also includes other existing methods as special cases. It has been demonstrated here that there are fundamental relationships between many topological properties of recurrence networks and different nontrivial statistical properties of the phase space density of the underlying dynamical system. Hence, this novel interpretation of the recurrence matrix yields new quantitative characteristics (such as average path length, clustering coefficient, or centrality measures of the recurrence network) related to the dynamical complexity of a time series, most of which are not yet provided by other existing methods of nonlinear time series analysis. 6},\n",

The approach is based on the research ideology that nonlinear features may not reveal differences between AD and control group in the band-limited EEG, but may represent noticeable differences in certain sub-bands. Hence, complexity of EEGs is computed using the VGs of EEGs and EEG sub-bands produced by wavelet decomposition. Two methods are employed for computation of complexity of the VGs: one based on the power of scale-freeness of a graph structure and the other based on the maximum eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of a graph. Analysis of variation is used for feature selection. Two classifiers are applied to the selected features to distinguish AD and control EEGs: a Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) and a two-stage classifier consisting of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the RBFNN. After comprehensive statistical studies, effective classification features and mathematical markers were discovered. Finally, using the discovered features and a two-stage classifier (PCA-RBFNN), a high diagnostic accuracy of 97.7{\\%} was obtained.},\n",

During the last years, intensive efforts have been spent on applying network-based concepts also for the analysis of dynamically relevant higher-order statistical properties of time series. Notably, many corresponding approaches are closely related with the concept of recurrence in phase space. In this paper, we review recent methodological advances in time series analysis based on complex networks, with a special emphasis on methods founded on recurrence plots. The potentials and limitations of the individual methods are discussed and illustrated for paradigmatic examples of dynamical systems as well as for real-world time series. Complex network measures are shown to provide information about structural features of dynamical systems that are complementary to those characterized by other methods of time series analysis and, hence, substantially enrich the knowledge gathered from other existing (linear as well as nonlinear) approaches.},\n",

As an alternative to existing methods of time series analysis, in this paper we argue that the statistical proper- ties of recurrence networks – a recently developed approach – are promising candidates for characterising the system's nonlinear dynamics and quantifying structural changes in its reconstructed phase space as time evolves. In a first order approximation, the results of recurrence network analysis are invariant to changes in the age model and are not directly af- fected by non-equidistant sampling of the data. Specifically, we investigate the behaviour of recurrence network measures for both paradigmatic model systems with non-stationary pa- rameters and four marine records of long-term palaeoclimate variations. We show that the obtained results are qualita- tively robust under changes of the relevant parameters of our method, including detrending, size of the running window used for analysis, and embedding delay. We demonstrate that recurrence network analysis is able to detect relevant regime shifts in synthetic data as well as in problematic geoscien- tific time series. This suggests its application as a general exploratory tool of time series analysis complementing ex- isting methods.},\n",

The analysis of paleoclimate archives encoding the environmental variability in East Africa during the past 5 Ma has triggered an ongoing debate about possible candidate processes and evolutionary mechanisms. In this work, we apply a nonlinear statistical technique, recurrence network analysis, to three distinct marine records of terrigenous dust flux. Our method enables us to identify three epochs with transitions between qualitatively different types of environmental variability in North and East Africa during the (i) Middle Pliocene (3.35-3.15 Ma B.P.), (ii) Early Pleistocene (2.25-1.6 Ma B.P.), and (iii) Middle Pleistocene (1.1-0.7 Ma B.P.). A deeper examination of these transition periods reveals potential climatic drivers, including (i) large-scale changes in ocean currents due to a spatial shift of the Indonesian throughflow in combination with an intensification of Northern Hemisphere glaciation, (ii) a global reorganization of the atmospheric Walker circulation induced in the tropical Pacific and Indian Ocean, and (iii) shifts in the dominating temporal variability pattern of glacial activity during the Middle Pleistocene, respectively. A reexamination of the available fossil record demonstrates statistically significant coincidences between the detected transition periods and major steps in hominin evolution. This result suggests that the observed shifts between more regular and more erratic environmental variability may have acted as a trigger for rapid change in the development of humankind in Africa.},\n",

      "    abstract = {Nonlinear time series analysis aims at understanding the dynamics of stochastic or chaotic processes. In recent years, quite a few methods have been proposed to transform a single time series to a complex network so that the dynamics of the process can be understood by investigating the topological properties of the network. We study the topological properties of horizontal visibility graphs constructed from fractional Brownian motions with different Hurst indexes H ∈ (0,1). Special attention has been paid to the impact of the Hurst index on topological properties. It is found that the clustering coefficient C decreases when H increases. We also found that the mean length L of the shortest paths increases exponentially with H for fixed length N of the original time series. In addition, L increases linearly with respect to N when H is close to 1 and in a logarithmic form when H is close to 0. Although the occurrence of different motifs changes with H, the motif rank pattern remains unchanged for different H. Adopting the node-covering box-counting method, the horizontal visibility graphs are found to be fractals and the fractal dimension dBdecreases with H. Furthermore, the Pearson coefficients of the networks are positive and the degree-degree correlations increase with degree, which indicate that the horizontal visibility graphs are assortative. With the increase of H, the Pearson coefficient decreases first and then increases, in which the turning point is around H = 0.6. The presence of both fractality and assortativity in the horizontal visibility graphs converted from fractional Brownian motions is different from many cases where fractal networks are usually disassortative. {\\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we develop this area further by introducing a network construction procedure for pseudoperiodic time series. We call such networks episode networks, in which an episode corresponds to a temporal interval of a time series, and which defines a node in the network. Our model includes a number of features which distinguish it from current methods. First, the proposed construction procedure is a parametric model which allows it to adapt to the characteristics of the data; the length of an episode being the parameter. As a direct consequence, networks of minimal size containing the maximal information about the time series can be obtained. In this paper, we provide an algorithm to determine the optimal value of this parameter. Second, we employ estimates of mutual information values to define the connectivity structure among the nodes in the network to exploit efficiently the nonlinearities in the time series. Finally, we apply our method to data from electroencephalogram (EEG) experiments and demonstrate that the constructed episode networks capture discriminative information from the underlying time series that may be useful for diagnostic purposes.},\n",

Nevertheless, it has recently been realised that a considerable number of systems of interest should be treated, more appropriately, as interacting networks or networks of networks. Here we introduce a novel graph-theoretical framework for studying the interaction structure between subnetworks embedded within a complex network of networks. This framework allows us to quantify the structural role of single vertices or whole subnetworks with respect to the interaction of a pair of subnetworks on local, mesoscopic and global topological scales. Climate networks have recently been shown to be a powerful tool for the analysis of climatological data. Applying the general framework for studying interacting networks, we introduce coupled climate subnetworks to represent and investigate the topology of statistical relationships between the fields of distinct climatological variables. Using coupled climate subnetworks to investigate the terrestrial atmosphere's three-dimensional geopotential height field uncovers known as well as interesting novel features of the atmosphere's vertical stratification and general circulation. Specifically, the new measure \"cross-betweenness\" identifies regions which are particularly important for mediating vertical wind field interactions. The promising results obtained by following the coupled climate subnetwork approach present a first step towards an improved understanding of the Earth system and its complex interacting components from a network perspective.},\n",

      "    abstract = {Studying the interaction between a system's components and the temporal evolution of the system are two common ways to uncover and characterize its internal workings. Recently, several maps from a time series to a network have been proposed with the intent of using network metrics to characterize time series. Although these maps demonstrate that different time series result in networks with distinct topological properties, it remains unclear how these topological properties relate to the original time series. Here, we propose a map from a time series to a network with an approximate inverse operation, making it possible to use network statistics to characterize time series and time series statistics to characterize networks. As a proof of concept, we generate an ensemble of time series ranging from periodic to random and confirm that application of the proposed map retains much of the information encoded in the original time series (or networks) after application of the map (or its inverse). Our results suggest that network analysis can be used to distinguish different dynamic regimes in time series and, perhaps more importantly, time series analysis can provide a powerful set of tools that augment the traditional network analysis toolkit to quantify networks in new and useful ways.},\n",

      "    abstract = {A great variety of systems in nature, society and technology -- from the web of sexual contacts to the Internet, from the nervous system to power grids -- can be modeled as graphs of vertices coupled by edges. The network structure, describing how the graph is wired, helps us understand, predict and optimize the behavior of dynamical systems. In many cases, however, the edges are not continuously active. As an example, in networks of communication via email, text messages, or phone calls, edges represent sequences of instantaneous or practically instantaneous contacts. In some cases, edges are active for non-negligible periods of time: e.g., the proximity patterns of inpatients at hospitals can be represented by a graph where an edge between two individuals is on throughout the time they are at the same ward. Like network topology, the temporal structure of edge activations can affect dynamics of systems interacting through the network, from disease contagion on the network of patients to information diffusion over an e-mail network. In this review, we present the emergent field of temporal networks, and discuss methods for analyzing topological and temporal structure and models for elucidating their relation to the behavior of dynamical systems. In the light of traditional network theory, one can see this framework as moving the information of when things happen from the dynamical system on the network, to the network itself. Since fundamental properties, such as the transitivity of edges, do not necessarily hold in temporal networks, many of these methods need to be quite different from those for static networks.},\n",

Thus, it is important to understand not only the dynamics of individual time series but also their interactions. Although there are many methods for analysing the interaction between two or more time series, there are very few methods that describe global changes of the interactions over time. Here, we propose an approach to visualise time evolution for the global changes of the interactions in complex systems. This approach consists of two steps. In the first step, we construct a meta-time series of networks. In the second step, we analyse and visualise this meta-time series by using distance and recurrence plots. Our two-step approach involving intermediate network representations elucidates the half-a-day periodicity of foreign exchange markets and a singular functional network in the brain related to perceptual alternations.},\n",

We have recently shown [B. Luque et al., PLoS ONE 6, 9 (2011)] that dynamical systems can be studied from a novel perspective via the use of this method. Specifically, the period-doubling and band-splitting attractor cascades that characterize unimodal maps transform into families of graphs that turn out to be independent of map nonlinearity or other particulars. Here, we provide an in depth description of the HV treatment of the Feigenbaum scenario, together with analytical derivations that relate to the degree distributions, mean distances, clustering coefficients, etc., associated to the bifurcation cascades and their accumulation points. We describe how the resultant families of graphs can be framed into a renormalization group scheme in which fixed-point graphs reveal their scaling properties. These fixed points are then re-derived from an entropy optimization process defined for the graph sets, confirming a suggested connection between renormalization group and entropy optimization. Finally, we provide analytical and numerical results for the graph entropy and show that it emulates the Lyapunov exponent of the map independently of its sign.},\n",

This method maps a time series to a directed network according to a geometric criterion. The degree of irreversibility of the series is then estimated by the Kullback-Leibler divergence (i.e. the distinguishability) between the in and out degree distributions of the associated graph. The method is computationally effi- cient, does not require any ad hoc symbolization process, and naturally takes into account multiple scales. We find that the method correctly distinguishes between reversible and irreversible station- ary time series, including analytical and numerical studies of its performance for: (i) reversible stochastic processes (uncorrelated and Gaussian linearly correlated), (ii) irreversible stochastic pro- cesses (a discrete flashing ratchet in an asymmetric potential), (iii) reversible (conservative) and irreversible (dissipative) chaotic maps, and (iv) dissipative chaotic maps in the presence of noise. Two alternative graph functionals, the degree and the degree-degree distributions, can be used as the Kullback-Leibler divergence argument. The former is simpler and more intuitive and can be used as a benchmark, but in the case of an irreversible process with null net current, the degree-degree distribution has to be considered to identifiy the irreversible nature of the series.},\n",

The potentials of the individual measures for discriminating phase-coherent and noncoherent chaotic oscillations are discussed. A detailed numerical analysis is performed for the chaotic Rössler system, which displays both types of chaos as one control parameter is varied, and the Mackey-Glass system as an example of a time-delay system with noncoherent chaos. Our results demonstrate that especially geometric measures from recurrence network analysis are well suited for tracing transitions between spiral- and screw-type chaos, a common route from phase-coherent to noncoherent chaos also found in other nonlinear oscillators. A detailed explanation of the observed behavior in terms of attractor geometry is given.},\n",

      "    abstract = {Recurrence networks are a powerful nonlinear tool for time series analysis of complex dynamical systems. While there are already many successful applications ranging from medicine to paleoclimatology, a solid theoretical foundation of the method has still been missing so far. Here, we interpret an ɛ-recurrence network as a discrete subnetwork of a \"continuous\" graph with uncountably many vertices and edges corresponding to the system's attractor. This step allows us to show that various statistical measures commonly used in complex network analysis can be seen as discrete estimators of newly defined continuous measures of certain complex geometric properties of the attractor on the scale given by ɛ. In particular, we introduce local measures such as the ɛ-clustering coefficient, mesoscopic measures such as ɛ-motif density, path-based measures such as ɛ-betweennesses, and global measures such as ɛ-efficiency. This new analytical basis for the so far heuristically motivated network measures also provides an objective criterion for the choice of ɛ via a percolation threshold, and it shows that estimation can be improved by so-called node splitting invariant versions of the measures. We finally illustrate the framework for a number of archetypical chaotic attractors such as those of the Bernoulli and logistic maps, periodic and two-dimensional quasiperiodic motions, and for hyperballs and hypercubes by deriving analytical expressions for the novel measures and comparing them with data from numerical experiments. More generally, the theoretical framework put forward in this work describes random geometric graphs and other networks with spatial constraints, which appear frequently in disciplines ranging from biology to climate science.},\n",

Then we convert these time series into networks using the horizontal visibility graph technique. Multifractal analysis of the resulting networks is performed using an algorithm proposed by us. The results from the multifractal analysis show that multifractality exists in both raw daily time series of X-ray brightness and their horizontal visibility graphs. It is also found that the empirical K(q) curves of raw time series can be fitted by the universal multifractal model. The numerical results on the raw data show that the Solar Cycle 23 is weaker than the Solar Cycle 22 in multifractality. The values of h(2) from multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis for these time series indicate that they are stationary and persistent, and the correlations in the time series of Solar Cycle 23 are stronger than those for Solar Cycle 22. Furthermore, the multifractal scaling for the networks of the time series can reflect some properties which cannot be picked up by using the same analysis on the original time series. This suggests a potentially useful method to explore geophysical data.},\n",

      "    abstract = {Recently, the visibility graph (VG) algorithm was proposed for mapping a time series to a graph to study complexity and fractality of the time series through investigation of the complexity of its graph. The visibility graph algorithm converts a fractal time series to a scale-free graph. VG has been used for the investigation of fractality in the dynamic behavior of both artificial and natural complex systems. However, robustness and performance of the power of scale-freeness of VG (PSVG) as an effective method for measuring fractality has not been investigated. Since noise is unavoidable in real life time series, the robustness of a fractality measure is of paramount importance. To improve the accuracy and robustness of PSVG to noise for measurement of fractality of time series in biological time-series, an improved PSVG is presented in this paper. The proposed method is evaluated using two examples: a synthetic benchmark time series and a complicated real life Electroencephalograms (EEG)-based diagnostic problem, that is distinguishing autistic children from non-autistic children. It is shown that the proposed improved PSVG is less sensitive to noise and therefore more robust compared with PSVG. Further, it is shown that using improved PSVG in the wavelet-chaos neural network model of Adeli and c-workers in place of the Katz fractality dimension results in a more accurate diagnosis of autism, a complicated neurological and psychiatric disorder. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The inheritance of the visibility graph from the original time series was further explored in the paper. We found that degree distributions of visibility graphs extracted from Pseudo Brownian Motion series obtained by the Frequency Domain algorithm exhibit exponential behaviors, in which the exponential exponent is a binomial function of the Hurst index inherited in the time series. Our simulations presented that the quantitative relations between the Hurst indexes and the exponents of degree distribution function are different for different series and the visibility graph inherits some important features of the original time series. Further, we convert some quarterly macroeconomic series including the growth rates of value-added of three industry series and the growth rates of Gross Domestic Product series of China to graphs by the visibility algorithm and explore the topological properties of graphs associated from the four macroeconomic series, namely, the degree distribution and correlations, the clustering coefficient, the average path length, and community structure. Based on complex network analysis we find degree distributions of associated networks from the growth rates of value-added of three industry series are almost exponential and the degree distributions of associated networks from the growth rates of GDP series are scale free. We also discussed the assortativity and disassortativity of the four associated networks as they are related to the evolutionary process of the original macroeconomic series. All the constructed networks have \"small-world\" features. The community structures of associated networks suggest dynamic changes of the original macroeconomic series. We also detected the relationship among government policy changes, community structures of associated networks and macroeconomic dynamics. We find great influences of government policies in China on the changes of dynamics of GDP and the three industries adjustment. The work in our paper provides a new way to understand the dynamics of economic development. {\\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},\n",

      "    abstract = {Chaotic attractors are known to often exhibit not only complex dynamics but also a complex geometry in phase space. In this work, we provide a detailed characterization of chaotic electrochemical oscillations obtained experimentally as well as numerically from a corresponding mathematical model. Power spectral density and recurrence time distributions reveal a considerable increase of dynamic complexity with increasing temperature of the system, resulting in a larger relative spread of the attractor in phase space. By allowing for feasible coordinate transformations, we demonstrate that the system, however, remains phase-coherent over the whole considered parameter range. This finding motivates a critical review of existing definitions of phase coherence that are exclusively based on dynamical characteristics and are thus potentially sensitive to projection effects in phase space. In contrast, referring to the attractor geometry, the gradual changes in some fundamental properties of the system commonly related to its phase coherence can be alternatively studied from a purely structural point of view. As a prospective example for a corresponding framework, recurrence network analysis widely avoids undesired projection effects that otherwise can lead to ambiguous results of some existing approaches to studying phase coherence. Our corresponding results demonstrate that since temperature increase induces more complex chaotic chemical reactions, the recurrence network properties describing attractor geometry also change gradually: the bimodality of the distribution of local clustering coefficients due to the attractor's band structure disappears, and the corresponding asymmetry of the distribution as well as the average path length increase.},\n",

One of the advantages of the complex network method for studying time series is that complex network theory provides a tool to describe either important nodes, or structures that exist in the networks, at different topological scale. This can then provide distinct information for time series of different dynamical systems. In this paper, we systematically investigate the recurrence-based phase space network of order k that has previously been used to specify different types of dynamics in terms of the motif ranking from a different perspective. Globally, we find that the network size scales with different scale exponents and the degree distribution follows a quasi-symmetric bell shape around the value of 2k with different values of degree variance from periodic to chaotic R?ssler systems. Local network properties such as the vertex degree, the clustering coefficients and betweenness centrality are found to be sensitive to the local stability of the orbits and hence contain complementary information.},\n",

      "    abstract = {With the rapid technological advancement, network is almost everywhere in our daily life. Network theory leads to a new way to investigate the dynamics of complex systems. As a result, many methods are proposed to construct a network from nonlinear time series, including the partition of state space, visibility graph, nearest neighbors, and recurrence approaches. However, most previous works focus on deriving the adjacency matrix to represent the complex network and extract new network-theoretic measures. Although the adjacency matrix provides connectivity information of nodes and edges, the network geometry can take variable forms. The research objective of this article is to develop a self-organizing approach to derive the steady geometric structure of a network from the adjacency matrix. We simulate the recurrence network as a physical system by treating the edges as springs and the nodes as electrically charged particles. Then, force-directed algorithms are developed to automatically organize the network geometry by minimizing the system energy. Further, a set of experiments were designed to investigate important factors (i.e., dynamical systems, network construction methods, force-model parameter, nonhomogeneous distribution) affecting this self-organizing process. Interestingly, experimental results show that the self-organized geometry recovers the attractor of a dynamical system that produced the adjacency matrix. This research addresses a question, i.e., \"what is the self-organizing geometry of a recurrence network?\" and provides a new way to reproduce the attractor or time series from the recurrence plot. As a result, novel network-theoretic measures (e.g., average path length and proximity ratio) can be achieved based on actual node-to-node distances in the self-organized network topology. The paper brings the physical models into the recurrence analysis and discloses the spatial geometry of recurrence networks.},\n",

      "    abstract = {We sought to analyze the dynamic properties of brain electrical activity from healthy volunteers and epilepsy patients using recurrence networks. Phase-space trajectories of synchronous electroencephalogram signals were obtained through embedding dimension in phase-space reconstruction based on the distance set of space points. The recurrence matrix calculated from phase-space trajectories was identified with the adjacency matrix of a complex network. Then, we applied measures to characterize the complex network to this recurrence network. A detailed analysis revealed the following: (1) The recurrence networks of normal brains exhibited a sparser connectivity and smaller clustering coefficient compared with that of epileptic brains; (2) the small-world property existed in both normal and epileptic brains consistent with the previous empirical studies of structural and functional brain networks; and (3) the assortative property of the recurrence network was found by computing the assortative coefficients; their values increased from normal to epileptic brain which accurately suggested the difference of the states. These universal and non-universal characteristics of recurrence networks might help clearly understand the underlying neurodynamics of the brain and provide an efficient tool for clinical diagnosis.},\n",

Second, we introduce a construction procedure for growing networks that is based on these step sequences.

Then, we infer multivariate recurrence networks from the experimental data and investigate the cross-transitivity for each constructed network. We find that the cross-transitivity allows quantitatively uncovering the flow behavior when the stratified flow evolves from a stable state to an unstable one and recovers deeper insights into the mechanism governing the formation of droplets at the interface of stratified flows, a task that existing methods based on AOK TFR fail to work.

A novel scheme is proposed to predict AF by using multi-threshold spectra of the recurrence complex network. Firstly, epicardial signals are transformed into the recurrence complex network to quantify structural properties of the recurrence in the phase space. Spectral parameters with multi-threshold are used to characterize the global structure of the network. Then the feature sequential forward searching algorithm and mutual information based Maximum Relevance Minimum Redundancy criterion are used to find the optimal feature set. Finally, a support vector machine is used to predict the occurrence of AF. This method is assessed on the pre-AF epicardial signals of canine which includes the normal group A (no further AF will happen), the mild group B (the following AF time is less than 180 s) and the severe group C (the following AF time is more than 180 s). 25 optimal features are selected out of 180 features from each sample. With these features, sensitivity, specificity and accuracy are 99.40{\\%}, 99.70{\\%} and 99.60{\\%}, respectively, which are the best among the recurrence based methods. The results suggest that the proposed method can predict AF accurately and thus can be prospectively used in the postoperative evaluation. {\\textcopyright} 2012 IPEM.},\n",

The application of the most effective algorithm to the typical chaotic Lorenz system verifies the correctness of such an effective algorithm. It is verified that, based on the unthresholded RPs, one can reconstruct the original attractor by choosing different RP thresholds based on the Hirata algorithm. It is shown that, in real applications, it is possible to reconstruct the underlying dynamics by using quite little information from observations of real dynamical systems.

The ECoG data from 3 patients with epilepsy are analyzed in this study. A recently developed algorithm in graph theory, visibility graph (VG), is applied in this research. The approach is based on the key discovery that high-frequency oscillation takes place during epileptic seizure, making it a marker of epilepsy. Therefore, the nonlinear property of the high-frequency signal may be more noticeable. Hence, a complexity measure, called graph index complexity (GIC), is computed using the VG of the patients' high-frequency ECoG subband. After comparison and statistical analysis, the nonlinear feature is proved to be effective in detection and location of the epilepsy. Two different traditional complexities, sample entropy and Lempel-Ziv, were also calculated to make a comparison and prove that GIC provides better identification.},\n",

      "    abstract = {Network theory provides a rich toolbox consisting of methods, measures, and models for studying the structure and dynamics of complex systems found in nature, society, or technology. Recently, it has been pointed out that many real-world complex systems are more adequately mapped by networks of interacting or interdependent networks, e.g., a power grid showing interdependency with a communication network. Additionally, in many real-world situations it is reasonable to include node weights into complex network statistics to reflect the varying size or importance of subsystems that are represented by nodes in the network of interest. E.g., nodes can represent vastly different surface area in climate networks, volume in brain networks or economic capacity in trade networks. In this letter, combining both ideas, we derive a novel class of statistical measures for analysing the structure of networks of interacting networks with heterogeneous node weights. Using a prototypical spatial network model, we show that the newly introduced node-weighted interacting network measures indeed provide an improved representation of the underlying system's properties as compared to their unweighted analogues. We apply our method to study the complex network structure of cross-boundary trade between European Union (EU) and non-EU countries finding that it provides important information on trade balance and economic robustness.},\n",

In all cases, the dependence of the relative number of clusters on the proximity to the critical angle of view had a power law behavior. Thus, it was shown that there is a similarity between the behavior of the relative number of clusters and the order parameter in the second-order phase transition theory and percolation theory.

Varying the strength of coupling often leads to qualitative changes in the complex dynamics of the mutually coupled systems including different types of synchronisation such as phase, lag, generalised, or even complete synchronisation. Here, we study the geometric signatures of coupling along with the onset of generalised synchronisation between two coupled chaotic oscillators by mapping the systems' individual as well as joint recurrences in phase space to a complex network. For a paradigmatic continuous-time model system, the transitivity properties of the resulting joint recurrence networks display distinct variations associated with changes in the structural similarity between different parts of the considered trajectories. They therefore provide a useful indicator for the emergence of generalised synchronisation. This paper is dedicated to the 25th anniversary of the introduction of recurrence plots by Eckmann et al.

We perform a visibility-graph analysis on both the daily and monthly sunspot series. Based on the data, we propose two ways to construct the network: one is from the original observable measurements and the other is from a negative-inverse-transformed series. The degree distribution of the derived networks for the strong maxima has clear non-Gaussian properties, while the degree distribution for minima is bimodal. The long-term variation of the cycles is reflected by hubs in the network that span relatively large time intervals. Based on standard network structural measures, we propose to characterize the long-term correlations by waiting times between two subsequent events. The persistence range of the solar cycles has been identified over 15–1000 days by a power-law regime with scaling exponent $\\gamma$ = 2.04 of the occurrence time of two subsequent strong minima. In contrast, a persistent trend is not present in the maximal numbers, although maxima do have significant deviations from an exponential form. Our results suggest some new insights for evaluating existing models.},\n",

Firstly, HVGEs and SaEs are extracted from 1,200 recordings of biomedical signals, respectively. A statistical analysis method is employed to choose the optimal channels to identify the abnormalities in alcoholics. Five group chan-nels are selected and forwarded to a K-Nearest Neighbour (K-NN) and a support vector machine (SVM) to conduct classification, respectively. The experimental results show that the HVGEs associated with left hemisphere, C1, C3 and FC5 electrodes, of alcoholics are significantly abnor-mal. The accuracy of classification with 10-fold cross-validation is 87.5 {\\%} with about three HVGE features. By using just optimal 13-dimension HVGE features, the accuracy is 95.8 {\\%}. In contrast, SaE features associated cannot identify the left hemisphere disorder for alcoholism and the maximum classification ratio based on SaE is just 95.2 {\\%} even using all channel signals.

The gap discovered between international crude oil prices and the crude oil price based on exchange rates may indicate the fluctuation of the forex burden. There exist different fluctuant patterns in the fluctuation process of the forex burden in different periods. Hence, we proposed an approach combining econometrics and complex network theory to explore the transmission mechanism of these fluctuant patterns. In this study, we defined the forex burden and the fluctuant patterns by normalization, sliding windows of data and econometric models. And then we set the fluctuant patterns as nodes and the transformation between patterns as edges; in this way, the transmission complex network is constructed. The results show that different major fluctuant patterns with different probabilities appear in different scales. The fluctuant patterns transferred into each other conveniently. And the transmission medium can help to identify the transitional periods in the process of the transmission. The contribution of this study to the energy policy decision-making is that the formulations of related policies under different period lengths require different reference standards. {\\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},\n",

      "    abstract = {Signals from heart transplant recipients can be considered to be a natural source of information for a better understanding of the impact of the autonomic nervous system on the complexity of heart rate variability. Beat-to-beat heart rate variability can be represented as a network of increments between subsequent {\\$}RR{\\$}-intervals, which makes possible the visualization of short-term heart period fluctuations. A network is constructed of vertices representing increments between subsequent {\\$}RR{\\$}-intervals, and edges which connect adjacent {\\$}RR{\\$}-increments. Two modes of visualization of such a network are proposed. The method described is applied to nocturnal Holter signals recorded from healthy young people and from cardiac transplant recipients. Additionally, the analysis is performed on surrogate data: shuffled RR-intervals (to display short-range dependence), and shuffled phases of the Fourier Transform of RR-intervals (to filter out linear dependences). Important nonlinear properties of autonomic nocturnal regulation in short-term variability in healthy young persons are associated with {\\$}RR{\\$}-increments: accelerations and decelerations of a size greater than about 35 ms. They reveal that large accelerations are more likely antipersistent, while large decelerations are more likely persistent. Changes in {\\$}RR{\\$}-increments in a heart deprived of autonomic supervision are much lower than in a healthy individual, and appear to be maintained around a homeostatic state, but there are indications that this dynamics is nonlinear. The method is fruitful in the evaluation of the vagal activity - the quantity and quality of the vagal tone - during the nocturnal rest of healthy young people. The method also successfully extracts nonlinear effects related to intrinsic mechanisms of the heart regulation.},\n",

Recent works show that the degree distribution of these graphs encapsulates much information on the signals variability, and therefore constitutes a fundamental feature for statistical learning purposes. However, exact solutions for the degree distributions are only known in a few cases, such as for uncorrelated random processes. Here we analytically explore these distributions in a list of situations. We present a diagrammatic formalism which computes for all degrees their corresponding probability as a series expansion in a coupling constant which is the number of hidden variables. We offer a constructive solution for general Markovian stochastic processes and deterministic maps. As case tests we focus on Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes, fully chaotic and quasiperiodic maps. Whereas only for certain degree probabilities can all diagrams be summed exactly, in the general case we show that the perturbation theory converges. In a second part, we make use of a variational technique to predict the complete degree distribution for special classes of Markovian dynamics with fast-decaying correlations. In every case we compare the theory with numerical experiments.},\n",

For a given time series, we first generate a set of segments via a sliding window, and then use a doubly symbolic scheme to characterize every windowed segment by combining absolute amplitude information with an ordinal pattern characterization. Based on this construction, a network can be directly constructed from the given time series: segments corresponding to different symbol-pairs are mapped to network nodes and the temporal succession between nodes is represented by directed links. With this conversion, dynamics underlying the time series has been encoded into the network structure. We illustrate the potential of our networks with a well-studied dynamical model as a benchmark example. Results show that network measures for characterizing global properties can detect the dynamical transitions in the underlying system. Moreover, we employ a random walk algorithm to sample loops in our networks, and find that time series with different dynamics exhibits distinct cycle structure. That is, the relative prevalence of loops with different lengths can be used to identify the underlying dynamics.},\n",

Traditionally, this asymmetry has been studied by considering amplitude and phase differences. Here, we use visibility graphs, a novel tool of nonlinear time series analysis, to obtain complementary information on hemispheric asymmetries in dynamical properties. Our analysis provides deep insights into the potential and limitations of this method, revealing a complex interplay between factors relating to statistical and dynamical properties, i.e., effects due to the probability distribution and the regularity of observed fluctuations. We demonstrate that temporal changes in the hemispheric predominance of the graph properties lag those directly associated with the total hemispheric sunspot areas. Our findings open a new dynamical perspective on studying the north–south sunspot asymmetry, which is to be further explored in future work.},\n",

Based on the concept of state-space reconstruction, this set of methods allows us to compute characteristic quantities such as Lyapunov exponents and fractal dimensions, to predict the future course of the time series, and even to reconstruct the equations of motion in some cases. In practice, however, there are a number of issues that restrict the power of this approach: whether the signal accurately and thoroughly samples the dynamics, for instance, and whether it contains noise. Moreover, the numerical algorithms that we use to instantiate these ideas are not perfect; they involve approximations, scale parameters, and finite-precision arithmetic, among other things. Even so, nonlinear time-series analysis has been used to great advantage on thousands of real and synthetic data sets from a wide variety of systems ranging from roulette wheels to lasers to the human heart. Even in cases where the data do not meet the mathematical or algorithmic requirements to assure full topological conjugacy, the results of nonlinear time-series analysis can be helpful in understanding, characterizing, and predicting dynamical systems.},\n",

In general, these methods claim to construct complex networks that preserve certain properties of the underlying dynamical system, and hence, they mark new ways of accessing quantitative indicators based on that dynamics. In this paper, we test this assertion by developing an algorithm to realize dynamical systems from these complex networks in such a way that trajectories of these dynamical systems produce time series that preserve certain statistical properties of the original time series (and hence, also the underlying true dynamical system). Trajectories from these networks are constructed from only the information in the network and are shown to be statistically equivalent to the original time series. In the context of this algorithm, we are able to demonstrate that the so-called adaptive k-nearest neighbour algorithm for generating networks out-performs methods based on -ball recurrence plots. For such networks, and with a suitable choice of parameter values, which we provide, the time series generated by this method function as a new kind of nonlinear surrogate generation algorithm. With this approach, we are able to test whether the simulation dynamics built from a complex network capture the underlying structure of the original system; whether the complex network is an adequate model of the dynamics.},\n",

First, we introduce a fixed time lag for the elements of each partition that is selected using techniques from traditional time delay embedding. The resulting partitions define regions in the embedding phase space that are mapped to nodes in the network space. Edges are allocated between nodes based on temporal succession thus creating a Markov chain representation of the time series. We then apply this new transformation algorithm to time series generated by the R{\\{}{\\\"{o}}{\\}}ssler system and find that periodic dynamics translate to ring structures whereas chaotic time series translate to band or tube-like structures—thereby indicating that our algorithm generates networks whose structure is sensitive to system dynamics. Furthermore, we demonstrate that simple network measures including the mean out degree and variance of out degrees can track changes in the dynamical behaviour in a manner comparable to the largest Lyapunov exponent. We also apply the same analysis to experimental time series generated by a diode resonator circuit and show that the network size, mean shortest path length, and network diameter are highly sensitive to the interior crisis captured in this particular data set.},\n",

We found statistically significant evidence that the financial market is not random and that there are similar characteristics between parts and whole time series. A few types of autoregressive sub-patterns and transmission patterns drive the oscillations of the financial market. A clustering effect on fluctuations appears in the transmission process, and certain non-major autoregressive sub-patterns have high media capabilities in the financial time series.

The first method explores matrices arising from networks of transitions constructed following events represented by a time series. The second method considers distributions of ordinal patterns of length three, whereby patterns with repeated values are counted as different patterns. Both methods provide estimators of dynamical aspects of short-term heartbeat signals obtained from nocturnal Holter electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings of healthy people of different ages and genders. The deceleration capacity, arising from the adjacency matrix of the network, and the entropy rate, resulting from the transition matrix of the network, are also calculated, and both significantly decay with aging. As people age, the permutation entropy grows, due to the increase in patterns with repeated values. All of these estimators describe in a consistent way changes in the beat-to-beat heart period dynamics caused by aging. An overall slowing down of heart period changes is observed, and an increase of permutation entropy results from the progressive increase of patterns with repeated values. This result points to the sympathetic drive becoming dominant in cardiac regulation of nocturnal heart rate with age.},\n",

One efficient way to characterize complex systems is to measure time series and then extract information from the measurements. We propose a reliable method for constructing a multiscale complex network from multivariate time series. In particular, for a given multivariate time series, we first perform a coarse-grained operation to define temporal scales and then reconstruct the multivariate phase-space for each scale to infer multiscale complex networks. In addition, we develop a novel clustering coefficient entropy to assess the derived multiscale complex networks, aiming to characterize the coupled dynamical characteristics underlying multivariate time series. We apply our proposed approach to the analysis of multivariate time series measured from gas-liquid two-phase flow experiments. The results yield novel insights into the inherent coupled flow behavior underlying a realistic multiphase flow system. Bridging multiscale analysis and complex network provides a fascinating methodology for probing multiscale complex behavior underlying complex systems.},\n",

Moreover, it has also been found that this technique can give reliable results with test data of comparatively short length. In this work, the visibility graph algorithm has been used for mapping a time series-EEG signals-to a graph to study complexity and fractality of the time series through investigation of its complexity. The power of scale-freeness of visibility graph has been used as an effective method for measuring fractality in the EEG signal. The scale-freeness of the visibility graph has also been observed after averaging the statistically independent samples of the signal. Scale-freeness of the visibility graph has been calculated for 5 sets of EEG data patterns varying from normal eye closed to epileptic. The change in the values is analyzed further, and it has been observed that it reduces uniformly from normal eye closed to epileptic.},\n",

The arriving probabilities of random walker in the network are utilized as the weights of the corresponding data. Compared with the classical OWA, the proposed OVGWA not only takes the information of orders but also the argument values themselves into consideration to determine the weights.

In addition, the aggregated results are compared with those obtained by maximal entropy method. The results show that the proposed method is effective.

The correlation between the bivariate time series fluctuates over time. The transmission among the correlation modes exhibits a multiscale phenomenon, which provides richer information. To investigate the multiscale transmission of the correlation modes, this paper describes a hybrid model integrating wavelet analysis and complex network theory to decompose and reconstruct the original bivariate time series into sequences in a joint time-frequency domain and defined the correlation modes at each time-frequency domain. We chose the crude oil spot and futures prices as the sample data. The empirical results indicate that the main duration of volatility (32-64 days) for the strongly positive correlation between the crude oil spot price and the futures price provides more useful information for investors. Moreover, the weighted degree, weighted indegree and weighted outdegree of the correlation modes follow power-law distributions. The correlation fluctuation strengthens the extent of persistence over the long term, whereas persistence weakens over the short and medium term. The primary correlation modes dominating the transmission process and the major intermediary modes in the transmission process are clustered both in the short and long term.},\n",

Further, we take into account other topological properties such as maximum eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix and the degree assortativity, and show that such topological quantities can also be used to predict the Hurst exponent, with an exception for anti-persistent fractional Gaussian noises.

This procedure converts a time series to a temporal network and at the same time a network of networks.

Our results demonstrate that RN analysis can indeed provide meaningful results for stationary stochastic processes, given a proper selection of its intrinsic methodological parameters, whereas it is prone to fail to uniquely retrieve RN properties for nonstationary stochastic processes like fBm.},\n",

For dissipative systems, characteristics based on recurrence plots have recently attracted much interest for discriminating qualitatively different types of dynamics in terms of measures of complexity, dynamical invariants, or even structural characteristics of the underlying attractor's geometry in phase space. Here, we demonstrate that the latter approach also provides a corresponding distinction between different co-existing dynamical regimes of the standard map, a paradigmatic example of a low-dimensional conservative system. Specifically, we show that the recently developed approach of recurrence network analysis provides potentially useful geometric characteristics distinguishing between regular and chaotic orbits. We find that chaotic orbits in an intermittent laminar phase (commonly referred to as sticky orbits) have a distinct geometric structure possibly differing in a subtle way from those of regular orbits, which is highlighted by different recurrence network properties obtained from relatively short time series. Thus, this approach can help discriminating regular orbits from laminar phases of chaotic ones, which presents a persistent challenge to many existing chaos detection techniques.},\n",

      "    abstract = {We report on a large-scale characterization of river discharges by employing the network framework of the horizontal visibility graph. By mapping daily time series from 141 different stations of 53 Brazilian rivers into complex networks, we present a useful approach for investigating the dynamics of river flows. We verified that the degree distributions of these networks were well described by exponential functions, where the characteristic exponents are almost always larger than the value obtained for random time series. The faster-than-random decay of the degree distributions is an another evidence that the fluctuation dynamics underlying the river discharges has a long-range correlated nature. We further investigated the evolution of the river discharges by tracking the values of the characteristic exponents (of the degree distribution) and the global clustering coefficients of the networks over the years. We show that the river discharges in several stations have evolved to become more or less correlated (and displaying more or less complex internal network structures) over the years, a behavior that could be related to changes in the climate system and other man-made phenomena.},\n",

In this study, we investigate multifractal properties of connectivity time series resulting from the visibility graph applied to normally distributed time series generated by the Ito equations with multiplicative power-law noise. We show that multifractality of the connectivity time series (i.e., the series of numbers of links outgoing any node) increases with the exponent of the power-law noise. The multifractality of the connectivity time series could be due to the width of connectivity degree distribution that can be related to the exit time of the associated Ito time series. Furthermore, the connectivity time series are characterized by persistence, although the original Ito time series are random; this is due to the procedure of visibility graph that, connecting the values of the time series, generates persistence but destroys most of the nonlinear correlations. Moreover, the visibility graph is sensitive for detecting wide \"depressions\" in input time series.},\n",

      "    abstract = {In this chapter, we concentrate on a mapping from time series to graphs, the visibility algorithm introduced by Lacasa et al. [1]. In order to cite some of its most relevant features, we will stress its intrinsic nonlocality, low computational cost, straightforward implementation, and quite \" simple \" way of inheriting the time series properties in the structure of the associated graphs. These features will make it easier to find connections between the underlying processes and the networks obtained from them by a direct analysis of the latter. In particular, in this chapter, we will focus the implementation of the algorithm of visibility to three known routes to chaos. We will define a graph entropy and process of renormalization for visibility graphs that characterize these routes and analyze the relationship between the flow of renormalization and the extremes of the entropy function. Disregarding any underlying process, we can consider a time series just as an ordered set of values and transform this set into a different mathematical object with the aids of an abstract mapping [2, 3]. We can then ask which properties of the original set are conserved, which are transformed and how, what can we say about one of the mathematical representations just by looking at the other. This exercise is of mathematical interest by itself. In addition, it turns out that time series or signals is a universal method of extracting information from dynamical systems in any field of science. Therefore, the preceding mathematical mapping gains some unexpected practical interest as it opens the possibility of analyzing a time series from an alternative point of view. Of course, the relevant information stored in the original time series should be somehow conserved in the mapping. The motivation is completed when the new representation belongs to a relatively mature mathematical field, where information encoded in such a representation can be effectively disentangled and processed. This is, precisely, the first motiva-tion to map time series into networks. This motivation is increased by two interconnected factors: (i) Although a mature field, time series analysis has some limitations, when it refers to study the so-called complex signals. Beyond the linear regime, there exists a wide range of phenomena, which are usually embraced in the field of the so-called complex systems. Dynamical phenomena such as chaos, long-range correlated stochastic processes, intermittency, and multifractality are examples of complex phenomena, where time series analysis is pushed to its own limits. Nonlinear time series analysis develops from techniques such as nonlinear correlation functions, embedding algorithms, multrifractal spectra, and projection theorem tools that increase in complexity parallel to the complexity of the process/series under study. New approaches to deal with complexity are not only welcome, but needed. Approaches dealing with the intrinsic nonlinearity by being intrinsically nonlinear in turn deal with the possible multiscale character of the underlying process by being designed to naturally incorporated multiple scales, and such is the framework of networks, of graph theory. (ii) The technological era brings us the possibility to digitally analyze myriads of data in a glimpse. Massive data sets can nowadays be parsed, and with the aid of well-suited algorithms, we can gain access and filter data from many processes, let it be of physical, technological, or even social garment.},\n",

In our method, a new support function based on distance is proposed to measure the support degree of each other. The advantage is that the VGPA operator fully takes into account not only the relationship but also the correlation degree between the values. Compared with VGA operator, numerical results show more effectiveness on the proposed operator. Finally, the analysis of the Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization Weighted Stock Index (TAIEX) is used to illustrate the application of the VGPA operator.

Inspired by recent effort on using network metrics to characterize time series for classification, we present an approach to visualize time series as complex networks based on the first order Markov process in its temporal ordering. In contrast to the classical bar charts, line plots and other statistics based graph, our approach delivers more intuitive visualization that better preserves both the temporal dependency and frequency structures. It provides a natural inverse operation to map the graph back to time series, making it possible to use graph statistics to characterize time series for better visual exploration and statistical analysis. Our experimental results suggest the effectiveness on various tasks such as system identification, pattern mining and classification on both synthetic and the real time series data.},\n",

      "    abstract = {Objective To show that time-irreversible EEG signals recorded with intracranial electrodes during seizures can serve as markers of the epileptogenic zone. Methods We use the recently developed method of mapping time series into directed horizontal graphs (dHVG). Each node of the dHVG represents a time point in the original intracranial EEG (iEEG) signal. Statistically significant differences between the distributions of the nodes' number of input and output connections are used to detect time-irreversible iEEG signals. Results In 31 of 32 seizure recordings we found time-irreversible iEEG signals. The maximally time-irreversible signals always occurred during seizures, with highest probability in the middle of the first seizure half. These signals spanned a large range of frequencies and amplitudes but were all characterized by saw-tooth like shaped components. Brain regions removed from patients who became post-surgically seizure-free generated significantly larger time-irreversibilities than regions removed from patients who still had seizures after surgery. Conclusions Our results corroborate that ictal time-irreversible iEEG signals can indeed serve as markers of the epileptogenic zone and can be efficiently detected and quantified in a time-resolved manner by dHVG based methods. Significance Ictal time-irreversible EEG signals can help to improve pre-surgical evaluation in patients suffering from pharmaco-resistant epilepsies.},\n",

Several methods have been proposed to this end, but most utilize too many features and produce unsuitable results. In the present, features are extracted based on the predicted secondary structures. At first, predicted secondary structure sequences are mapped into two time series by the chaos game representation. Then, a recurrence matrix is calculated from each of the time series. The recurrence matrix is identified with the adjacency matrix of a complex network and measures are applied for the characterization of complex networks to these recurrence matrixes. For a given protein sequence, a total of 24 characteristic features can be calculated and these are fed into Fisher's discriminated analysis algorithm for classification. To examine the proposed method, two widely used low similarity benchmark datasets design and test its performance. A comparison with the results of existing methods shows that the current study's approach provides a satisfactory performance for protein structural class prediction.},\n",

We show that this metric is complementary to standard measures based on volatility and exploit it to both classify periods of financial stress and to rank companies accordingly.

      "    abstract = {Exploiting the duality between time series and networks, directed horizontal visibility graphs (DHVGs) are used to perform an unprecedented analysis of the dynamics of stream flow fluctuations with focus on time irreversibility and long range dependence. The analysis relies on a large quality-controlled data set consisting of 699 daily time series recorded in the continental United States (CONUS) that are not affected by human activity and primarily reflects meteorological conditions. DHVGs allow a clear visualization and quantification of time irreversibility of flow dynamics, which can be interpreted as a signature of nonlinearity, and long range dependence resulting from the interaction of atmospheric, surface and underground processes acting at multiple spatio-temporal scales. Irreversibility is explored by mapping the time series into ingoing, outgoing, and undirected graphs and comparing the corresponding degree distributions. Using surrogate data preserving up to the second order linear temporal dependence properties of the observed series, DHVGs highlight the additional complexity introduced by nonlinearity into flow fluctuation dynamics. We show that the degree distributions do not decay exponentially as expected, but tend to follow a subexponential behavior, even though sampling uncertainty does not allow a clear distinction between apparent or true power law decay. These results confirm that the complexity of stream flow dynamics goes beyond a linear representation involving for instance the combination of linear processes with short and long range dependence, and requires modeling strategies accounting for temporal asymmetry and nonlinearity.},\n",

The measure is applied to compute the heterogeneity of synthetic (both random and scale free) and real world networks with its value normalized in the interval [0, 1]. To define the measure, we introduce a limiting network whose heterogeneity can be expressed analytically with the value tending to 1 as the size of the network N tends to infinity. We numerically study the variation of heterogeneity for random graphs (as a function of p and N) and for scale free networks with and N as variables. Finally, as a specific application, we show that the proposed measure can be used to compare the heterogeneity of recurrence networks constructed from the time series of several low dimensional chaotic attractors9thereby providing a single index to compare the structural complexity of chaotic attractors.},\n",

At seasonal and inter-seasonal timescales, the summer monsoon of one hemisphere is linked via outflows from the winter monsoon of the opposing hemisphere. Long-term phase relationships between the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) and the Indonesian–Australian summer monsoon (IASM) are poorly understood, raising questions of long-term adjustments to future greenhouse-triggered climate change and whether these changes could 'lock in' possible IASM and EASM phase relationships in a region dependent on monsoonal rainfall. Here we show that a newly developed nonlinear time series analysis technique allows confident identification of strong versus weak monsoon phases at millennial to sub-centennial timescales.

However, the patient's electrocardiogram and exercise parameters seemed largely inconclusive in this regard. The exercise heart rate dynamics were suggestive of only mild, if any parasympathetic reinnervation of the graft with persisting sympathetic activation. On the other hand, traditional heart rate variability (HRV) indices were inadequately high, due to erratic rhythm resulting from interference of the persisting recipient sinus node or non-conducted atrial parasystole. New tools, originated from network representation of time series, by visualization short-term dynamical patterns, provided a method to discern HRV increase due to reinnervation from other reasons.},\n",

However, the structure of the attractor is found to be robust even upto high noise levels of 50{\\%}. An advantage of recurrence network measures over the conventional nonlinear measures is that they can be applied on short and non stationary time series data. By using the results obtained from the above analysis, we go on to analyse the light curves from a dominant black hole system and show that the recurrence network measures are capable of identifying the nature of noise contamination in a time series.},\n",

Although some dynamical behaviors can be effectively captured by existing approaches, the preservation and tracking of the temporal behaviors of a chaotic system remains an open problem. In this work, we extended the visibility graphlet approach to investigate both discrete and continuous chaotic time series. We applied visibility graphlets to capture the reconstructed local states, so that each is treated as a node and tracked downstream to create a temporal chain link. Our empirical findings show that the approach accurately captures the dynamical properties of chaotic systems. Networks constructed from periodic dynamic phases all converge to regular networks and to unique network structures for each model in the chaotic zones. Furthermore, our results show that the characterization of chaotic and non-chaotic zones in the Lorenz system corresponds to the maximal Lyapunov exponent, thus providing a simple and straightforward way to analyze chaotic systems.},\n",

Counting forbidden patterns has been shown to be a powerful tool towards the detection of determinism in noisy time series. They constitute a set of ordinal symbolic patterns that cannot be realised in time series generated by deterministic systems. The reliability of the estimator of the relative count of forbidden patterns from irregularly sampled data has been explored in two recent studies. In this paper, we explore highly irregular sampling frequency schemes. Using numerically generated data, we examine the reliability of the estimator when the sampling period has been drawn from exponential, Pareto and Gamma distributions of varying skewness. Our investigations demonstrate that some statistical properties of the sampling distribution are useful heuristics for assessing the estimator's reliability. We find that sampling in the presence of large chronological gaps can still yield relatively accurate estimates as long as the time series contains sufficiently many densely sampled areas. Furthermore, we show that the reliability of the estimator of forbidden patterns is poor when there is a high number of sampling intervals, which are larger than a typical correlation time of the underlying system.},\n",

Specifically, we focus on the case of k-nearest neighbour networks, which have already been shown to contain meaningful (and more importantly, easily accessible) information about dynamics. Superfamily phenomena have previously been identified, although a complete explanation for its appearance was not provided. Local dimension of the attractor is presented as one possible determinant, discussing the ability of specific motifs to be embedded in various dimensions. In turn, the Lyapunov spectrum provides the link between attractor dimension and dynamics required. We also prove invertibility of k-nearest neighbour networks. A new metric is provided, under which the k-nearest neighbour and $\\epsilon$-recurrence construction methods produce identical networks. Hence, the already established $\\epsilon$-recurrence inversion algorithm applies equally to the k-nearest neighbour case, and inversion is proved. The change in metric necessarily distorts the shape of the reconstructed attractor, although topology is conserved.},\n",

This approach yields weighted directed networks representing the pattern transition properties of time series in velocity space, which hence provides dynamic insights of the underling system. Furthermore, we propose a measure of entropy to characterize ordinal partition transition dynamics, which is sensitive to capturing the possible local geometric changes of phase space trajectories. We demonstrate the applicability of pattern transition networks to capture phase coherence to non-coherence transitions, and to characterize paths to phase synchronizations. Therefore, we conclude that the ordinal partition transition network approach provides complementary insight to the traditional symbolic analysis of nonlinear multivariate time series.},\n",

      "    abstract = {In this study, we propose a new information theoretic measure to quantify the complexity of biological systems based on time-series data. We demonstrate the potential of our method using two distinct applications to human cardiac dynamics. Firstly, we show that the method clearly discriminates between segments of electrocardiogram records characterized by normal sinus rhythm, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. Secondly, we investigate the multiscale complexity of cardiac dynamics with respect to age in healthy individuals using interbeat interval time series and compare our findings with a previous study which established a link between age and fractal-like long-range correlations. The method we use is an extension of the symbolic mapping procedure originally proposed for permutation entropy. We build a Markov chain of the dynamics based on order patterns in the time series which we call an ordinal network, and from this model compute an intuitive entropic measure of transitional complexity. A discussion of the model parameter space in terms of traditional time delay embedding provides a theoretical basis for our multiscale approach. As an ancillary discussion, we address the practical issue of node aliasing and how this effects ordinal network models of continuous systems from discrete time sampled data, such as interbeat interval time series.This article is part of the themed issue {\\{}$\\backslash$textquoteleft{\\}}Mathematical methods in medicine: neuroscience, cardiology and pathology{\\{}$\\backslash$textquoteright{\\}}.},\n",

The dynamics of thermoacoustic system is the result of complex nonlinear interactions between the subsystems-turbulent reactive flow and the acoustic field of the combustor. In order to study the transitions between the dynamical regimes in such a complex system, the time series corresponding to one of the dynamic variables is transformed to an ɛ-recurrence network. The topology of the recurrence network resembles the structure of the attractor representing the dynamics of the system. The transitions in the thermoacoustic system are then captured as the variation in the topological characteristics of the network. We show the presence of power law degree distribution in the recurrence networks constructed from time series acquired during the occurrence of combustion noise and during the low amplitude aperiodic oscillations prior to lean blowout. We also show the absence of power law degree distribution in the recurrence networks constructed from time series acquired during the occurrence of thermoacoustic instability and during the occurrence of intermittency. We demonstrate that the measures derived from recurrence network can be used as tools to capture the transitions in the turbulent combustor and also as early warning measures for predicting impending thermoacoustic instability and blowout.},\n",

Here we extend this method to characterize spatially extended data structures by mapping scalar fields of arbitrary dimension into graphs. After introducing several possible extensions, we provide analytical results on some topological properties of these graphs associated to some types of real-valued matrices, which can be understood as the high and low disorder limits of real-valued scalar fields. In particular, we find a closed expression for the degree distribution of these graphs associated to uncorrelated random fields of generic dimension, extending a well known result in one-dimensional time series. As this result holds independently of the field's marginal distribution, we show that it directly yields a statistical randomness test, applicable in any dimension. We showcase its usefulness by discriminating spatial snapshots of two-dimensional white noise from snapshots of a two-dimensional lattice of diffusively coupled chaotic maps, a system that generates high dimensional spatio-temporal chaos. We finally discuss the range of potential applications of this combinatorial framework, which include image processing in engineering, the description of surface growth in material science, soft matter or medicine and the characterization of potential energy surfaces in chemistry, disordered systems and high energy physics. An illustration on the applicability of this method for the classification of the different stages involved in carcinogenesis is briefly discussed.},\n",

It has been recently conjectured that there is a critical value of exponent $\\lambda$c=ln3/2, which separates chaotic from correlated stochastic processes. Here, we systematically apply (H)VG analysis to time series from autoregressive (AR) models, which confirms the hypothesis that an increased correlation length results in larger values of $\\lambda$ {\\textgreater} $\\lambda$c. On the other hand, we numerically find a regime of negatively correlated process increments where $\\lambda$ {\\textless} $\\lambda$c, which is in contrast to this hypothesis. Furthermore, by constructing graphs based on re-sampled time series, we find that network measures show non-trivial dependencies on the autocorrelation functions of the processes.

It is thus an open question why these seemingly simple measures capture so much information. Here we prove that, under suitable conditions, there exist a bijection between the adjacency matrix of an HVG and its degree sequence, and we give an explicit construction of such bijection. As a consequence, under these conditions HVGs are unigraphs and the degree sequence fully encapsulates all the information of these graphs, thereby giving a plausible reason for its apparently unreasonable effectiveness.},\n",

By taking into account the all-round information carried by the signals, the time irreversibility and fractal behavior of series are evaluated from a complex network perspective, and considered signals are further classified from different aspects. The reliability of the proposed analysis is supported by numerical simulations on synthesized uncorrelated random noise, short-term correlated chaotic systems and long-term correlated fractal processes, and by the empirical analysis on daily closing prices of eleven worldwide stock indices. Obtained results suggest that finite size has a significant effect on the evaluation, and that there might be no direct relation between the time irreversibility and long-range correlation of series. Similarity and dissimilarity between stock indices are also indicated from respective regional and global perspectives, showing the existence of multiple features of underlying systems.},\n",

We applied the Kullback–Leibler divergence D that is a metric for quantifying the degree of time-irreversibility in time series. Our findings suggest that among the five seismic areas, Jalisco–Colima is characterized by time-reversibility in all the four seismic series. Our results are consistent with the peculiar seismo-tectonic characteristics of Jalisco–Colima, which is the closest to the Middle American Trench and belongs to the Mexican volcanic arc.},\n",

Our test statistic is the largest difference in expectations over functions in the unit ball of a reproducing kernel Hilbert space ({RKHS}), and is called the maximum mean discrepancy ({MMD}).  We present two distribution-free tests based on large deviation bounds for the {MMD}, and a third test based on the asymptotic distribution of this statistic.  The {MMD} can be computed in quadratic time, although efficient linear time approximations are available.  Our statistic is an instance of an integral probability metric, and various classical metrics on distributions are obtained when alternative function classes are used in place of an {RKHS}.  We apply our two-sample tests  to a variety of problems, including attribute matching for databases using the Hungarian marriage method, where they perform strongly.  Excellent performance is also obtained when comparing distributions over graphs, for which these are the first such tests.},\n",

The {NKN} architecture is based on the composition rules for kernels, so that each unit of the network corresponds to a valid kernel. It can compactly approximate compositional kernel structures such as those used by the Automatic Statistician (Lloyd et al., 2014), but because the architecture is differentiable, it is end-to-end trainable with gradient-based optimization. We show that the {NKN} is universal for the class of stationary kernels. Empirically we demonstrate pattern discovery and extrapolation abilities of {NKN} on several tasks that depend crucially on identifying the underlying structure, including time series and texture extrapolation, as well as Bayesian optimization.},\n",

      "    abstract = {A Hilbert space embedding of a distribution---in short, a kernel mean embedding---has recently emerged as a powerful tool for machine learning and inference. The basic idea behind this framework is to map distributions into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space ({RKHS}) in which the whole arsenal of kernel methods can be extended to probability measures. It can be viewed as a generalization of the original \"feature map\" common to support vector machines ({SVMs}) and other kernel methods. While initially closely associated with the latter, it has meanwhile found application in fields ranging from kernel machines and probabilistic modeling to statistical inference, causal discovery, and deep learning. The goal of this survey is to give a comprehensive review of existing work and recent advances in this research area, and to discuss the most challenging issues and open problems that could lead to new research directions. The survey begins with a brief introduction to the {RKHS} and positive definite kernels which forms the backbone of this survey, followed by a thorough discussion of the Hilbert space embedding of marginal distributions, theoretical guarantees, and a review of its applications. The embedding of distributions enables us to apply {RKHS} methods to probability measures which prompts a wide range of applications such as kernel two-sample testing, independent testing, and learning on distributional data. Next, we discuss the Hilbert space embedding for conditional distributions, give theoretical insights, and review some applications. The conditional mean embedding enables us to perform sum, product, and Bayes' rules---which are ubiquitous in graphical model, probabilistic inference, and reinforcement learning---in a non-parametric way. We then discuss relationships between this framework and other related areas. Lastly, we give some suggestions on future research directions.},\n",

These tests adapt to variations in distribution smoothness and shape over space, and are especially suited to high dimensions and complex data. By contrast, the simpler kernels used in prior kernel testing work are spatially homogeneous, and adaptive only in lengthscale. We explain how this scheme includes popular classifier-based two-sample tests as a special case, but improves on them in general. We provide the first proof of consistency for the proposed adaptation method, which applies both to kernels on deep features and to simpler radial basis kernels or multiple kernel learning. In experiments, we establish the superior performance of our deep kernels in hypothesis testing on benchmark and real-world data.

Analogous results apply for two correlation-based dependence functionals introduced earlier: we show the kernel canonical correlation and the kernel generalised variance to be independence measures for universal kernels, and prove the latter to be an upper bound on the mutual information near independence.

These closed-form kernels can be used as drop-in replacements for standard kernels, with beneﬁts in expressive power and scalability. We jointly learn the properties of these kernels through the marginal likelihood of a Gaussian process.

We also discuss the issue of kernel choice for the {MMD} critic, and characterize the kernel corresponding to the energy distance used for the Cramer {GAN} critic. Being an integral probability metric, the {MMD} benefits from training strategies recently developed for Wasserstein {GANs}. In experiments, the {MMD} {GAN} is able to employ a smaller critic network than the Wasserstein {GAN}, resulting in a simpler and faster-training algorithm with matching performance.

      "    abstract = {Current adoption of machine learning in industrial, societal and economical activities has raised concerns about the fairness, equity and ethics of automated decisions. Predictive models are often developed using biased datasets and thus retain or even exacerbate biases in their decisions and recommendations. Removing the sensitive covariates, such as gender or race, is insufficient to remedy this issue since the biases may be retained due to other related covariates. We present a regularization approach to this problem that trades off predictive accuracy of the learned models (with respect to biased labels) for the fairness in terms of statistical parity, i.e. independence of the decisions from the sensitive covariates. In particular, we consider a general framework of regularized empirical risk minimization over reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and impose an additional regularizer of dependence between predictors and sensitive covariates using kernel-based measures of dependence, namely the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion ({HSIC}) and its normalized version. This approach leads to a closed-form solution in the case of squared loss, i.e. ridge regression. Moreover, we show that the dependence regularizer has an interpretation as modifying the corresponding Gaussian process ({GP}) prior. As a consequence, a {GP} model with a prior that encourages fairness to sensitive variables can be derived, allowing principled hyperparameter selection and studying of the relative relevance of covariates under fairness constraints. Experimental results in synthetic examples and in real problems of income and crime prediction illustrate the potential of the approach to improve fairness of automated decisions.},\n",

By representing these probability distributions as mean embeddings in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space ({RKHS}), we are able to apply many standard kernel-based learning techniques in straightforward fashion. To accomplish this, we construct a generalization of the support vector machine ({SVM}) called a support measure machine ({SMM}). Our analyses of {SMMs} provides several insights into their relationship to traditional {SVMs}.

First, the empirical estimate is simpler than any other kernel dependence test, and requires no user-defined regularisation. Second, there is a clearly defined population quantity which the empirical estimate approaches in the large sample limit, with exponential convergence guaranteed between the two: this ensures that independence tests based on {HSIC} do not suffer from slow learning rates.

We investigate two applications of the proposed {IKL} as examples, including generative adversarial networks with {MMD} ({MMD} {GAN}) and standard supervised learning. Empirically, {MMD} {GAN} with {IKL} outperforms vanilla predefined kernels on both image and text generation benchmarks; using {IKL} with Random Kitchen Sinks also leads to substantial improvement over existing state-of-the-art kernel learning algorithms on popular supervised learning benchmarks.

One choice of test statistic is the maximum mean discrepancy ({MMD}), which is a distance between embeddings of the probability distributions in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. The kernel used in obtaining these embeddings is critical in ensuring the test has high power, and correctly distinguishes unlike distributions with high probability. A means of parameter selection for the two-sample test based on the {MMD} is proposed. For a given test level (an upper bound on the probability of making a Type I error), the kernel is chosen so as to maximize the test power, and minimize the probability of making a Type {II} error. The test statistic, test threshold, and optimization over the kernel parameters are obtained with cost linear in the sample size. These properties make the kernel selection and test procedures suited to data streams, where the observations cannot all be stored in memory. In experiments, the new kernel selection approach yields a more powerful test than earlier kernel selection heuristics.},\n",

Two tests are given, both based on an ensemble of distances between analytic functions representing each of the distributions. The first test uses smoothed empirical characteristic functions to represent the distributions, the second uses distribution embeddings in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Analyticity implies that differences in the distributions may be detected almost surely at a finite number of randomly chosen locations/frequencies. The new tests are consistent against a larger class of alternatives than the previous linear-time tests based on the (non-smoothed) empirical characteristic functions, while being much faster than the current state-of-the-art quadratic-time kernel-based or energy distance-based tests. Experiments on artificial benchmarks and on challenging real-world testing problems demonstrate that our tests give a better power/time tradeoff than competing approaches, and in some cases, better outright power than even the most expensive quadratic-time tests. This performance advantage is retained even in high dimensions, and in cases where the difference in distributions is not observable with low order statistics.},\n",

In this paper, we develop functional kernel learning ({FKL}) to directly infer functional posteriors over kernels. In particular, we place a transformed Gaussian process over a spectral density, to induce a non-parametric distribution over kernel functions. The resulting approach enables learning of rich representations, with support for any stationary kernel, uncertainty over the values of the kernel, and an interpretable specification of a prior directly over kernels, without requiring sophisticated initialization or manual intervention. We perform inference through elliptical slice sampling, which is especially well suited to marginalizing posteriors with the strongly correlated priors typical to function space modelling. We develop our approach for non-uniform, large-scale, multi-task, and multidimensional data, and show promising performance in a wide range of settings, including interpolation, extrapolation, and kernel recovery experiments.},\n",

      "    abstract = {The success of kernel methods is very much dependent on the choice of kernel. Kernel design and learning a kernel from the data require evaluation measures to assess the quality of the kernel. In recent years, the notion of kernel alignment, which measures the degree of agreement between a kernel and a learning task, is widely used for kernel selection due to its effectiveness and low computational complexity. In this paper, we present an overview of the research progress of kernel alignment and its applications. We introduce the basic idea of kernel alignment and its theoretical properties, as well as the extensions and improvements for specific learning problems. The typical applications, including kernel parameter tuning, multiple kernel learning, spectral kernel learning and feature selection and extraction, are reviewed in the context of classification framework. The relationship between kernel alignment and other evaluation measures is also explored. Finally, concluding remarks and future directions are presented.},\n",

In particular, as shown by our empirical results, these algorithms consistently outperform the so-called uniform combination solution that has proven to be difﬁcult to improve upon in the past, as well as other algorithms for learning kernels based on convex combinations of base kernels in both classiﬁcation and regression. Our algorithms are based on the notion of centered alignment which is used as a similarity measure between kernels or kernel matrices. We present a number of novel algorithmic, theoretical, and empirical results for learning kernels based on our notion of centered alignment. In particular, we describe efﬁcient algorithms for learning a maximum alignment kernel by showing that the problem can be reduced to a simple {QP} and discuss a one-stage algorithm for learning both a kernel and a hypothesis based on that kernel using an alignment-based regularization. Our theoretical results include a novel concentration bound for centered alignment between kernel matrices, the proof of the existence of effective predictors for kernels with high alignment, both for classiﬁcation and for regression, and the proof of stability-based generalization bounds for a broad family of algorithms for learning kernels based on centered alignment. We also report the results of experiments with our centered alignment-based algorithms in both classiﬁcation and regression.},\n",

      "    abstract = {Multiple kernel learning ({MKL}) is a principled approach to kernel combination and selection for a variety of learning tasks, such as classification, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. In this paper, we develop a novel fuzzy multiple kernel learning model based on the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion ({HSIC}) for classification, which we call {HSIC}-{FMKL}. In this model, we first propose an {HSIC} Lasso-based {MKL} formulation, which not only has a clear statistical interpretation that minimum redundant kernels with maximum dependence on output labels are found and combined, but also enables the global optimal solution to be computed efficiently by solving a Lasso optimization problem. Since the traditional support vector machine ({SVM}) is sensitive to outliers or noises in the dataset, fuzzy {SVM} ({FSVM}) is used to select the prediction hypothesis once the optimal kernel has been obtained. The main advantage of {FSVM} is that we can associate a fuzzy membership with each data point such that these data points can have different effects on the training of the learning machine. We propose a new fuzzy membership function using a heuristic strategy based on the {HSIC}. The proposed {HSIC}-{FMKL} is a two-stage kernel learning approach and the {HSIC} is applied in both stages. We perform extensive experiments on real-world datasets from the {UCI} benchmark repository and the application domain of computational biology which validate the superiority of the proposed model in terms of prediction accuracy.},\n",

These different kernels may correspond to using different notions of similarity or may be using information coming from multiple sources (different representations or different feature subsets). In trying to organize and highlight the similarities and differences between them, we give a taxonomy of and review several multiple kernel learning algorithms. We perform experiments on real data sets for better illustration and comparison of existing algorithms. We see that though there may not be large differences in terms of accuracy, there is difference between them in complexity as given by the number of stored support vectors, the sparsity of the solution as given by the number of used kernels, and training time complexity. We see that overall, using multiple kernels instead of a single one is useful and believe that combining kernels in a nonlinear or data-dependent way seems more promising than linear combination in fusing information provided by simple linear kernels, whereas linear methods are more reasonable when combining complex Gaussian kernels.},\n",

Whereas the existing work mainly pursues utilizing attributes for various computer vision problems, we contend that the most basic problem---how to accurately and robustly detect attributes from images---has been left under explored. Especially, the existing work rarely explicitly tackles the need that attribute detectors should generalize well across different categories, including those previously unseen. Noting that this is analogous to the objective of multi-source domain generalization, if we treat each category as a domain, we provide a novel perspective to attribute detection and propose to gear the techniques in multi-source domain generalization for the purpose of learning cross-category generalizable attribute detectors. We validate our understanding and approach with extensive experiments on four challenging datasets and three different problems.},\n",

      "    abstract = {The computational cost of training with softmax cross entropy loss grows linearly with the number of classes. For the settings where a large number of classes are involved, a common method to speed up training is to sample a subset of classes and utilize an estimate of the loss gradient based on these classes, known as the sampled softmax method. However, the sampled softmax provides a biased estimate of the gradient unless the samples are drawn from the exact softmax distribution, which is again expensive to compute. Therefore, a widely employed practical approach involves sampling from a simpler distribution in the hope of approximating the exact softmax distribution. In this paper, we develop the ﬁrst theoretical understanding of the role that different sampling distributions play in determining the quality of sampled softmax. Motivated by our analysis and the work on kernel-based sampling, we propose the Random Fourier Softmax ({RFsoftmax}) method that utilizes the powerful Random Fourier Features to enable more efﬁcient and accurate sampling from an approximate softmax distribution. We show that {RF}-softmax leads to low bias in estimation in terms of both the full softmax distribution and the full softmax gradient. Furthermore, the cost of {RF}-softmax scales only logarithmically with the number of classes.},\n",

The key advantage of this approach to regression is that it does not assume a particular distribution of the noise, i.e., it is non-parametric with respect to the noise distribution. We argue that the proposed regression method is well suited to the task of causal inference in additive noise models. A practical disadvantage is that the resulting optimization problem is generally non-convex and can be diﬃcult to solve. Nevertheless, we report good results on one of the tasks of the {NIPS} 2008 Causality Challenge, where the goal is to distinguish causes from eﬀects in pairs of statistically dependent variables. In addition, we propose an algorithm for eﬃciently inferring causal models from observational data for more than two variables.

      "    abstract = {Understanding, quantifying and predicting market fluctuation has become increasingly important in recent decades. Volatility and volume are the two commonly used quantities to study the market dynamics and the relationship between these two has been modeled and debated for years with several hypothesis been put forward. Using empirical data, we investigate the causality and correlation between volume and volatility and find new ways in which they interact, particularly when the levels of both are high. We find that the volume-conditional volatility distribution scales with volume as a power-law function with an exponential cutoff. We exploit the characteristics of a volume-volatility scatterplot and find a strong correlation between logarithmic volume and a quantity we define as local maximum volatility (LMV), the highest volatility observed in a given range of volume. This supports our empirical analysis, showing that volume is an effective parameter for prediction of the maximum value of volatility for both same-day and near-future time periods. The joint conditional probability of volume and volatility also indicates if we invoke both quantities, the prediction of the largest next-day volatility will be better than invoking either one alone. This approach is thus a greatly improved method of risk assessment.},\n",

      "    abstract = {Understanding, quantifying and predicting market fluctuation has become increasingly important in recent decades. Volatility and volume are the two commonly used quantities to study the market dynamics and the relationship between these two has been modeled and debated for years with several hypothesis been put forward. Using empirical data, we investigate the causality and correlation between volume and volatility and find new ways in which they interact, particularly when the levels of both are high. We find that the volume-conditional volatility distribution scales with volume as a power-law function with an exponential cutoff. We exploit the characteristics of a volume-volatility scatterplot and find a strong correlation between logarithmic volume and a quantity we define as local maximum volatility (LMV), the highest volatility observed in a given range of volume. This supports our empirical analysis, showing that volume is an effective parameter for prediction of the maximum value of volatility for both same-day and near-future time periods. The joint conditional probability of volume and volatility also indicates if we invoke both quantities, the prediction of the largest next-day volatility will be better than invoking either one alone. This approach is thus a greatly improved method of risk assessment.},\n",

      "    abstract = {Employing a recent technique which allows the representation of nonstationary data by means of a juxtaposition of locally stationary paths of different length, we introduce a comprehensive analysis of the key observables in a financial market: the trading volume and the price fluctuations. From the segmentation procedure we are able to introduce a quantitative description of statistical features of these two quantities, which are often named stylized facts, namely the tails of the distribution of trading volume and price fluctuations and a dynamics compatible with the U-shaped profile of the volume in a trading section and the slow decay of the autocorrelation function. The segmentation of the trading volume series provides evidence of slow evolution of the fluctuating parameters of each patch, pointing to the mixing scenario. Assuming that long-term features are the outcome of a statistical mixture of simple local forms, we test and compare different probability density functions to provide the long-term distribution of the trading volume, concluding that the log-normal gives the best agreement with the empirical distribution. Moreover, the segmentation of the magnitude price fluctuations are quite different from the results for the trading volume, indicating that changes in the statistics of price fluctuations occur at a faster scale than in the case of trading volume.},\n",
